To model a differential system of an economy based on accounts and their transactions, you can use a **flow-based approach** to represent the dynamics of money flows between accounts. This is often done using **system dynamics** or **network flow models**. Here's a step-by-step guide to building such a model:

---

### 1. **Define the Accounts as State Variables**
   - Each account in your system represents a **state variable** (e.g., \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \)), which corresponds to the amount of money in that account at any given time.
   - Let \( x_i(t) \) represent the balance of account \( i \) at time \( t \).

---

### 2. **Identify the Flows Between Accounts**
   - Use the table of transactions to determine how money flows between accounts.
   - Each transaction can be represented as a **flow rate** (e.g., \( f_{ij} \)), which is the rate at which money flows from account \( i \) to account \( j \).
   - Flows can be constant, time-dependent, or dependent on the state variables (e.g., proportional to the balance of an account).

---

### 3. **Write the Differential Equations**
   - The rate of change of each account's balance is determined by the inflows and outflows:
     \[
     \frac{dx_i}{dt} = \sum_{\text{inflows to } i} f_{ji} - \sum_{\text{outflows from } i} f_{ij}
     \]
   - For example, if account \( x_1 \) receives money from \( x_2 \) at a rate \( f_{21} \) and sends money to \( x_3 \) at a rate \( f_{13} \), the differential equation for \( x_1 \) would be:
     \[
     \frac{dx_1}{dt} = f_{21} - f_{13}
     \]
   - Repeat this for all accounts to create a system of differential equations.

---

### 4. **Model the Flow Rates**
   - The flow rates \( f_{ij} \) can be modeled in different ways depending on the system:
     - **Constant flows**: \( f_{ij} = c \) (a fixed rate).
     - **Proportional flows**: \( f_{ij} = k \cdot x_i \) (proportional to the balance of account \( i \)).
     - **Time-dependent flows**: \( f_{ij} = g(t) \) (a function of time).
     - **Nonlinear flows**: \( f_{ij} = h(x_i, x_j) \) (a function of the balances of both accounts).

---

### 5. **Set Initial Conditions**
   - Define the initial balances of all accounts at \( t = 0 \):
     \[
     x_i(0) = x_{i0}
     \]
   - These initial conditions are necessary to solve the system of differential equations.

---

### 6. **Solve the System**
   - Use numerical or analytical methods to solve the system of differential equations:
     - Analytical methods (if the system is simple and linear).
     - Numerical methods (e.g., Euler's method, Runge-Kutta) for more complex systems.

---

### 7. **Analyze the Results**
   - Examine the behavior of the system over time:
     - Do the account balances stabilize (steady state)?
     - Are there oscillations or exponential growth/decay?
   - Use the results to understand the dynamics of the economy and make predictions.

---

### Example
Suppose you have three accounts: \( x_1 \) (Households), \( x_2 \) (Firms), and \( x_3 \) (Government). The transactions are:
- Households pay taxes to the Government at a rate proportional to their balance: \( f_{13} = k_1 x_1 \).
- Firms pay wages to Households at a fixed rate: \( f_{21} = c \).
- Government spends on Firms at a rate proportional to its balance: \( f_{32} = k_2 x_3 \).

The system of differential equations would be:
\[
\frac{dx_1}{dt} = f_{21} - f_{13} = c - k_1 x_1
\]
\[
\frac{dx_2}{dt} = f_{32} - f_{21} = k_2 x_3 - c
\]
\[
\frac{dx_3}{dt} = f_{13} - f_{32} = k_1 x_1 - k_2 x_3
\]

You can then solve this system numerically or analytically, depending on the complexity.

---

### Tools for Implementation
- **Software**: Use tools like MATLAB, Python (with SciPy or Pyomo), or R to implement and solve the system.
- **Visualization**: Plot the results to visualize the dynamics of the economy.

By following these steps, you can model the differential system of an economy based on the accounts and their transactions.

Sure! Let’s solve **one step** of the system of differential equations using **Euler's method** and the **Runge-Kutta method (4th order)** using **math formulas only**. We’ll use the same example system and parameters as before.

---

### System of Differential Equations
The system is:
\[
\frac{dx_1}{dt} = c - k_1 x_1
\]
\[
\frac{dx_2}{dt} = k_2 x_3 - c
\]
\[
\frac{dx_3}{dt} = k_1 x_1 - k_2 x_3
\]

### Parameters and Initial Conditions
- \( c = 1.0 \), \( k_1 = 0.2 \), \( k_2 = 0.3 \)
- \( x_1(0) = 100 \), \( x_2(0) = 50 \), \( x_3(0) = 30 \)
- Time step \( h = 0.1 \)

---

### 1. **Euler's Method (One Step)**

Euler's method updates the state variables as:
\[
x_i(t + h) = x_i(t) + h \cdot f_i(x_1, x_2, x_3)
\]

#### Step 1: Compute the derivatives at \( t = 0 \)
\[
\frac{dx_1}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = c - k_1 x_1(0) = 1.0 - 0.2 \cdot 100 = 1.0 - 20 = -19
\]
\[
\frac{dx_2}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = k_2 x_3(0) - c = 0.3 \cdot 30 - 1.0 = 9.0 - 1.0 = 8.0
\]
\[
\frac{dx_3}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = k_1 x_1(0) - k_2 x_3(0) = 0.2 \cdot 100 - 0.3 \cdot 30 = 20 - 9 = 11
\]

#### Step 2: Update the state variables
\[
x_1(0 + h) = x_1(0) + h \cdot \frac{dx_1}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 100 + 0.1 \cdot (-19) = 100 - 1.9 = 98.1
\]
\[
x_2(0 + h) = x_2(0) + h \cdot \frac{dx_2}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 50 + 0.1 \cdot 8.0 = 50 + 0.8 = 50.8
\]
\[
x_3(0 + h) = x_3(0) + h \cdot \frac{dx_3}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 30 + 0.1 \cdot 11 = 30 + 1.1 = 31.1
\]

#### Results after one step of Euler's method:
\[
x_1(0.1) = 98.1, \quad x_2(0.1) = 50.8, \quad x_3(0.1) = 31.1
\]

---

### 2. **Runge-Kutta Method (4th Order, One Step)**

The Runge-Kutta method uses weighted averages of slopes at intermediate points. The update rule is:
\[
x_i(t + h) = x_i(t) + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\]
where \( k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 \) are intermediate slopes.

#### Step 1: Compute \( k_1 \) (slopes at \( t = 0 \))
\[
k_{1,x_1} = c - k_1 x_1(0) = 1.0 - 0.2 \cdot 100 = -19
\]
\[
k_{1,x_2} = k_2 x_3(0) - c = 0.3 \cdot 30 - 1.0 = 8.0
\]
\[
k_{1,x_3} = k_1 x_1(0) - k_2 x_3(0) = 0.2 \cdot 100 - 0.3 \cdot 30 = 11
\]

#### Step 2: Compute \( k_2 \) (slopes at \( t = 0 + h/2 \))
First, compute intermediate state variables:
\[
x_1^{(1)} = x_1(0) + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_{1,x_1} = 100 + 0.05 \cdot (-19) = 100 - 0.95 = 99.05
\]
\[
x_2^{(1)} = x_2(0) + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_{1,x_2} = 50 + 0.05 \cdot 8.0 = 50 + 0.4 = 50.4
\]
\[
x_3^{(1)} = x_3(0) + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_{1,x_3} = 30 + 0.05 \cdot 11 = 30 + 0.55 = 30.55
\]

Now compute \( k_2 \):
\[
k_{2,x_1} = c - k_1 x_1^{(1)} = 1.0 - 0.2 \cdot 99.05 = 1.0 - 19.81 = -18.81
\]
\[
k_{2,x_2} = k_2 x_3^{(1)} - c = 0.3 \cdot 30.55 - 1.0 = 9.165 - 1.0 = 8.165
\]
\[
k_{2,x_3} = k_1 x_1^{(1)} - k_2 x_3^{(1)} = 0.2 \cdot 99.05 - 0.3 \cdot 30.55 = 19.81 - 9.165 = 10.645
\]

#### Step 3: Compute \( k_3 \) (slopes at \( t = 0 + h/2 \))
First, compute intermediate state variables:
\[
x_1^{(2)} = x_1(0) + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_{2,x_1} = 100 + 0.05 \cdot (-18.81) = 100 - 0.9405 = 99.0595
\]
\[
x_2^{(2)} = x_2(0) + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_{2,x_2} = 50 + 0.05 \cdot 8.165 = 50 + 0.40825 = 50.40825
\]
\[
x_3^{(2)} = x_3(0) + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_{2,x_3} = 30 + 0.05 \cdot 10.645 = 30 + 0.53225 = 30.53225
\]

Now compute \( k_3 \):
\[
k_{3,x_1} = c - k_1 x_1^{(2)} = 1.0 - 0.2 \cdot 99.0595 = 1.0 - 19.8119 = -18.8119
\]
\[
k_{3,x_2} = k_2 x_3^{(2)} - c = 0.3 \cdot 30.53225 - 1.0 = 9.159675 - 1.0 = 8.159675
\]
\[
k_{3,x_3} = k_1 x_1^{(2)} - k_2 x_3^{(2)} = 0.2 \cdot 99.0595 - 0.3 \cdot 30.53225 = 19.8119 - 9.159675 = 10.652225
\]

#### Step 4: Compute \( k_4 \) (slopes at \( t = 0 + h \))
First, compute intermediate state variables:
\[
x_1^{(3)} = x_1(0) + h \cdot k_{3,x_1} = 100 + 0.1 \cdot (-18.8119) = 100 - 1.88119 = 98.11881
\]
\[
x_2^{(3)} = x_2(0) + h \cdot k_{3,x_2} = 50 + 0.1 \cdot 8.159675 = 50 + 0.8159675 = 50.8159675
\]
\[
x_3^{(3)} = x_3(0) + h \cdot k_{3,x_3} = 30 + 0.1 \cdot 10.652225 = 30 + 1.0652225 = 31.0652225
\]

Now compute \( k_4 \):
\[
k_{4,x_1} = c - k_1 x_1^{(3)} = 1.0 - 0.2 \cdot 98.11881 = 1.0 - 19.623762 = -18.623762
\]
\[
k_{4,x_2} = k_2 x_3^{(3)} - c = 0.3 \cdot 31.0652225 - 1.0 = 9.31956675 - 1.0 = 8.31956675
\]
\[
k_{4,x_3} = k_1 x_1^{(3)} - k_2 x_3^{(3)} = 0.2 \cdot 98.11881 - 0.3 \cdot 31.0652225 = 19.623762 - 9.31956675 = 10.30419525
\]

#### Step 5: Update the state variables
\[
x_1(0 + h) = x_1(0) + \frac{h}{6}(k_{1,x_1} + 2k_{2,x_1} + 2k_{3,x_1} + k_{4,x_1})
\]
\[
= 100 + \frac{0.1}{6}(-19 + 2(-18.81) + 2(-18.8119) + (-18.623762))
\]
\[
= 100 + \frac{0.1}{6}(-19 - 37.62 - 37.6238 - 18.623762)
\]
\[
= 100 + \frac{0.1}{6}(-112.867562) = 100 - 1.881126 = 98.118874
\]

\[
x_2(0 + h) = x_2(0) + \frac{h}{6}(k_{1,x_2} + 2k_{2,x_2} + 2k_{3,x_2} + k_{4,x_2})
\]
\[
= 50 + \frac{0.1}{6}(8.0 + 2(8.165) + 2(8.159675) + 8.31956675)
\]
\[
= 50 + \frac{0.1}{6}(8.0 + 16.33 + 16.31935 + 8.31956675)
\]
\[
= 50 + \frac{0.1}{6}(48.96891675) = 50 + 0.8161486 = 50.8161486
\]

\[
x_3(0 + h) = x_3(0) + \frac{h}{6}(k_{1,x_3} + 2k_{2,x_3} + 2k_{3,x_3} + k_{4,x_3})
\]
\[
= 30 + \frac{0.1}{6}(11 + 2(10.645) + 2(10.652225) + 10.30419525)
\]
\[
= 30 + \frac{0.1}{6}(11 + 21.29 + 21.30445 + 10.30419525)
\]
\[
= 30 + \frac{0.1}{6}(63.89864525) = 30 + 1.0649774 = 31.0649774
\]

#### Results after one step of Runge-Kutta:
\[
x_1(0.1) = 98.118874, \quad x_2(0.1) = 50.8161486, \quad x_3(0.1) = 31.0649774
\]

---
