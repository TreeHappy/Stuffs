Your question touches on **panpsychism**, theories of **collective consciousness**, and the social construction of reality (like money as a shared illusion). Below is a breakdown of key terms, theories, and frameworks that explore how consciousness, resonance, and shared belief shape reality:

---

### **1. Panpsychism: Consciousness as Fundamental**
Panpsychism posits that **consciousness is a universal property of matter**, present even in atoms or particles. This contrasts with materialism (mind emerges from brain activity) and dualism (mind and matter are separate). Key ideas:  
- **Cosmopsychism**: The universe itself is conscious, and individual minds are fragments of this cosmic consciousness.  
- **Panexperientialism** (Alfred North Whitehead): All entities, even subatomic particles, have some form of "experience" or proto-consciousness.  
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Consciousness arises from the integration of information in a system (e.g., brains, but potentially any complex network).  

**Relevance**: If consciousness is universal, human collective beliefs (like money) could be seen as *resonant patterns* in a conscious substrate, shaping reality through shared mental frameworks.

### **2. Resonance and Collective Consciousness**
The idea that individuals or groups "resonate" with shared beliefs draws from:  
- **Morphic Resonance** (Rupert Sheldrake): Systems (like societies) inherit collective memories or habits through non-physical "morphic fields."  
- **Collective Unconscious** (Carl Jung): Archetypes and symbols shared across humanity influence behavior and perception.  
- **Resonance Theory** (Hartmut Rosa): Modern societies prioritize "resonant relationships" (meaningful connections to people, nature, and institutions) over material growth.  

**Example**: Money’s value relies on **collective intentionality** (John Searle)—a shared belief in its worth. Propaganda works by hijacking these resonant symbols (e.g., national flags, religious icons) to unify beliefs.

### **3. Reality as a Social Construction**
The notion that reality is co-created through shared beliefs aligns with:  
- **Social Constructionism** (Berger & Luckmann): Institutions, norms, and concepts (e.g., money, borders) exist only because groups agree to behave *as if* they’re real.  
- **Hyperobjects** (Timothy Morton): Large-scale, intangible phenomena (e.g., climate change, capitalism) shape reality despite being imperceptible to individuals.  
- **Symbolic Interactionism** (George Herbert Mead): Reality is negotiated through language and symbols, which gain power through collective use.  

**Example**: Bitcoin is a **hyperobject**—its value depends on decentralized trust in blockchain technology, not physical backing.

### **4. Propaganda and the Mechanics of Shared Illusion**
Propaganda exploits the gap between objective reality and socially constructed beliefs. Key theories:  
- **Semiotics** (Ferdinand de Saussure): Symbols (e.g., currency, flags) derive meaning from cultural codes, not inherent properties.  
- **Hyperreality** (Jean Baudrillard): Media and propaganda create self-referential simulations (e.g., "fake news") that replace reality.  
- **Affect Theory** (Brian Massumi): Emotions, amplified by media, create collective psychological states that override rationality.  

**Case Study**: Fiat currencies collapse when trust erodes (e.g., hyperinflation in Zimbabwe), proving their existence depends on **consensus hallucination**.

### **5. Bridging Panpsychism and Social Reality**
Some speculative frameworks connect panpsychism to collective belief systems:  
- **Quantum Mind Theory**: Consciousness arises from quantum processes, allowing collective mental states to influence physical reality (e.g., the "observer effect" scaled to societies).  
- **Noosphere** (Teilhard de Chardin): A planetary "thinking layer" emerges from human interconnectedness, akin to a global mind.  
- **Memetics** (Richard Dawkins): Ideas ("memes") compete for dominance in a mental ecosystem, shaping culture and reality.  

**Example**: Religions or ideologies persist because their "memes" resonate with panpsychic proto-consciousness, creating self-reinforcing belief systems.

---

### **Key Terms to Explore**  
- **Ontological Pluralism**: Multiple realities coexist based on collective agreement.  
- **Egregore**: A metaphysical entity created by group belief (e.g., national identity).  
- **Intersubjectivity**: Shared understanding that stabilizes social constructs.  
- **The Reality Tunnel** (Robert Anton Wilson): Personal/collective filters shape perceived reality.

### **Conclusion: The Alchemy of Belief**
Your intuition aligns with ancient and modern ideas: **reality is a participatory act**. Money, laws, and nations exist because we collectively "dream" them into being—a process amplified by propaganda. Panpsychism adds a layer: if consciousness is universal, our shared illusions might tap into deeper cosmic patterns. As Terence McKenna said, "Culture is not your friend"—it’s a negotiated hallucination, vulnerable to those who control the symbols.
