To reorder an adjacency matrix into a Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) or Block Triangular Form (BTF), you can follow this high-level pseudo-code approach using graph theory concepts:

```plaintext
FUNCTION reorder_dsm(adj_matrix):
    // Step 1: Identify Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)
    scc_list = TARJANS_ALGORITHM(adj_matrix)
    
    // Step 2: Build DAG of SCCs and perform topological sort
    scc_dag = BUILD_SCC_DAG(scc_list, adj_matrix)
    topo_order = TOPOLOGICAL_SORT(scc_dag)
    
    // Step 3: Reorder nodes within each SCC using RCM and concatenate
    permutation = EMPTY_LIST
    FOR scc IN topo_order:
        subgraph = EXTRACT_SUBGRAPH(adj_matrix, scc)
        scc_perm = REVERSE_CUTHILL_MCKEE(subgraph)  // Apply bandwidth reduction
        permutation.APPEND(scc_perm)
    
    // Step 4: Flatten permutation and apply to matrix
    final_order = FLATTEN(permutation)
    reordered_matrix = adj_matrix[final_order, final_order]
    RETURN reordered_matrix
```

**Key Steps Explained**:
1. **SCC Detection** (Tarjan's Algorithm):  
   Groups nodes into clusters where each cluster is a maximally connected subgraph (cycles).

2. **Topological Sort on SCC DAG**:  
   Orders clusters such that dependencies flow unidirectionally (no cycles between clusters).

3. **Bandwidth Reduction Within Clusters** (Reverse Cuthill-McKee):  
   Minimizes the distance between connected nodes in each cluster for tighter blocks.

**Alternative Terms**:  
- Matrix Bandwidth Reduction  
- Block Triangularization  
- Hierarchical Clustering  
- Matrix Permutation for Sparsity  

**Notes**:  
- Replace `TARJANS_ALGORITHM`, `REVERSE_CUTHILL_MCKEE`, etc., with actual implementations.  
- For undirected graphs, use connected components instead of SCCs and skip topological sorting.  
- This approach minimizes off-diagonal dependencies, enhancing DSM readability.  

This method ensures that strongly interdependent components are grouped together, and clusters are ordered to reflect dependency flow, achieving a near-block-diagonal structure.
