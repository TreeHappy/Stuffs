''Formed in 2016, High Reeper is made up of Zach Thomas, Napz Mosley, Andrew Price, Pat Daly and Shane Trimble. Originally started as just a studio band, it rapidly became apparent that these songs were meant to be heard live and loud. The band made their debut in the Philly/DE stoner rock scene in early 2017 with success which was followed up by the recording of their self-titled debut in May. With a sound deeply rooted in modern stoner rock while still giving a nod to the earliest Sabbath records, High Reeper's first offering is driven by pounding rhythms, thick guitars and soaring, screeching vocals.''

Eternal Return, the fourth full length from Richmond, Virginia's heavy psychedelic quartet WINDHAND represents a new era for the group, a chrysalis moment that takes them to new and unforeseen heights. Across nine songs and 63 minutes, Eternal Return is an infectious display of songcraft cloaked in alluring atmosphere, molten fuzz, eerie psychedelia and ethereal vocals. The album was once again produced by Jack Endino (Nirvana, Soundgarden) with vivid artwork by Arik Roper (Sleep, High on Fire). Equally informed by heavy, fuzzed-out psych along with the iconic grunge / alternative groups of the 90s, WINDHAND have crafted a record brilliant in scope, powerful in execution, and perfect for an era of increasingly blurry yet still heavy borders.﻿

Acid Arab - Gul l’Abi (feat. A-WA) [Music Video],"A video clip project that expresses the mergence of diverse cultures and comprehensions by prioritizing aesthetic concerns. Influenced by the eastern culture, the project suggests a new “new world” concept, that is called “Neuland”. Indestructible denied by the women characters, masculine-dominant infrastructure has been faced a small yet an initiative response by taking down the imposer with what was imposed.

We would like to thank, primarily Acid Arab; for inspiring us with their song Gul L’Abi and allowing us using it, and everyone who took part in pre-production, production and post-production, who were there to contribute and to support our project.

The victims have been bled
Red velvet lines the black box

The virginal brides file past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers
Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room

The new Giöbia album “Plasmatic Idol” is simply impressive: a collection of different sounds and atmospheres, brings the listener to another sidereal world full of dreams and mind travels. You can clearly feel the influence of certain Pink Floyd in some passages but also pinches of Italian Progressive Rock, Horror Soundtrack from 70’s movies, garage 60’s influences, US West Coast Psychedelia, and late 60’s Space Rock a la Hawkwind The production is delicate and smooth, the album flows without interruptions and the music immerses your mind in a cosmic dimension. The vintage organs and synthesizers are used in the best way possible, 8 tracks that capture your attention without distraction. Recorded at Trai Studio in Inzago, Milano. Engineered by Fabio Intraina. Produced by Bazu the guitar player and singer of the band and mastered By Brett Orrison (Black Angels, Jack White) at Spaceflight Records in Austin, Texas. The Great cover album and artwork is by Metastazis.

The trio from Rostock is known for its heavy riffs, that try to crush you, switch to dreamy, almost shallow parts without distracting from the right path. It is probably just this very path, which drives the tension in the songs, builds up sprawling walls of sound and collapses by energetic and epic riffs.
On stage the three deliver a distinctive sound - big, loud and groovy as fuck!

A hollow cry rang out across the ether. The astral plains became quickly saturated with their surging beats and driving melodies, the ethereal reverberations permeated each atom, infusing and changing as it crept into every realm. It was in the desolate vacuum of space their cries met, and whether by chance or fate the two combined. 
This is how Dark Temple was birthed.

 With '1692', Frayle pushes the immense intensity and gorgeous ache of its unique sound and style through to uncompromising new plateaus. The group's quantum weight, hypnotic rhythms, dark beds of sound, and the arcane female power of Gwyn Strang have coalesced into a sonic thumbprint both distinct and beguiling. As Frayle's music inhales and exhales, building into atmospheric, chilly epics, Gwyn's lyrics explore her own personality and experiences, referencing and representing her frustrations growing up in a strict Roman Catholic family, as well as alchemical ideals such as changing negatives to positives, or ascending from one level of understanding to another. While there is much darkness on the record, it’s also contrasted superbly with beauty, both fragile and fierce, in a way that feels weightless rather than plummeting, as if release truly is a possibility. 

""'1692', as the title of our album, references those who have been singled out and persecuted for their beliefs,"" says Strang. ""“We strive to create a safe haven. A place to be vulnerable amongst the chaos.”

Besetzung

Das Konzert fand am 10.10.2018 während des Crossroads Festivals in der Bonner Harmonie statt.

Lucifers Mitglieder kommen aus Deutschland und Schweden, ihre Basis ist allerdings Stockholm. Gründerin und Frontfrau der Heavy Rock Band ist die charismatische Berlinerin Johanna Sadonis.
Johanna Sadonis hatte bereits Erfahrungen in Death-, Doom- und Black Metal Bands - u.a. bei The Oath - gesammelt, als sich 2014 Lucifer gründete. In ihrem sehr authentischen Sound vereint die Band Heavy Rock im Stil der 1970er, Doom Metal und Einflüsse aus Psychedelic Rock, ohne dabei wie eine Vintage-Band zu klingen. Zu den Haupteinflüssen von Lucifer zählen Bands wie Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Blue Öyster Cult, aber auch Heart oder Fleetwood Mac.
2016 zog Johanna Sadonis nach Schweden und fand in Hellacopters-Frontmann Nicke Andersson einen neuen musikalischen Partner. Ihr gemeinsames Werk „Lucifer II“ haben sie in Nickes Studio „The Honk Palace“ in Stockholm 2017 aufgenommen.

Listening to Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased, it becomes quickly apparent that something truly special was being birthed upon the band's first recorded notes. The first half of this collection - or sides A and B of the double-vinyl edition - comprise demos recorded in 2007. The first three songs were the very first written by HOUR OF 13 in November 2006 and then recorded not long after; the next five songs were recorded nearly a year later. Together, these eight songs would form the foundation of the band's now-classic debut album, released by SHADOW KINGDOM as Hour of 13. Although recognizably HOUR OF 13, these early demo versions of the debut album's songs have slightly different arrangements while others have slightly different vocals, but every single bit of the band's trademark atmosphere is plentiful and poignant. Verily, this is the sound of lingering incense and burning blood. 

During the second half of Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased, we find a number of alternate recordings, some with special circumstances surrounding them. On side C is an alternate full-band recording of ""Call To Satan,"" recorded at the HOUR OF 13 rehearsal spot, alongside an alternate version of ""The Rites of Samhain"" with fully correct lyric placement and vocals by mainman Chad Davis. But most poignantly is the song ""Upon Black Wings We Die,"" written and recorded within a matter of a few hours upon hearing the news of the passing of Jason McCash from The Gates Of Slumber. On side D are the complete Candlemass Eve Recordings, the second rehearsal with Beaten Back to Pure's Ben Hogg on vocals: all recorded in a single session on a Zoom H2 microphone in the room, captured here with a newfound energy and stirring vocal performance. Feel the ancient atmosphere of early metal rehearsal rooms of yesteryear here! 

As founder Chad Davis states in the liner notes to Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased, ""This album documents the times and tribulations that had shrouded HOUR OF 13, the early days of rejuvenation along with the dark days of contemplation, and serve as a testament of an entity capable of withstanding any obstacle in its path."" So far, the definitive HOUR OF 13 collection - and the cultest. Praise Him and enter the abyss!

''ZAUM is a passage toward the dark realizations of ancient civilization; in the form of a monolithic doomy mantra based meditative experience forged by bass and drums interwoven by sitar and synth textures. Based in New Brunswick – their live presence is very true to its recorded form featuring McDonald's both melodic and dark vocal styles met with elements of sectional Mongolian throat singing. Observers experience a calming process of reality whereby the astral and physical planes can co-exist and be understood from a natural perspective.''

Oh, I can't stop thinking of you
You are stuck in my head
Like a song
On repeat, but can't get
No refrain
I don't seem to mind
Sharing my brain

And you make me feel so drunk
When I am sober

I thought this was gonna be
Temporary insanity
But now I know that
I'm not alone
Nothing left to do but
See where it goes

And you make me feel so drunk
When I am sober
Oh, baby keep it up
I can never get enough

And I don't want nothing but you now

And you make me feel so drunk
When I am sober
Oh, baby keep it up
I can never get enough

====
Formed in late 2015 in a dark cavern beneath the streets of old Edinburgh, a lead-heavy brew of old school Metal and the meatiest of 70’s classic rock emerges in the form of King Witch. Bristling with dark majesty, they draw comparisons ranging from Black Sabbath and Candlemass to Mastodon and High On Fire. The band quickly earned themselves a reputation as a formidable live act and have toured the UK and Europe as well as playing festivals such as Sweden Rock, Muskel Rock, Malta Doom Fest, Dutch Doom Days and Siege of Limerick.

After self releasing their extremely well received EP “Shoulder of Giants”, the band were picked up by French label Listenable Records through which they released their debut album “Under The Mountain” in February 2018.

April 2020 will see the release of King Witch’s highly anticipated second album “Body of Light” which further focuses their ability to fuse dense riffage with haunting yet powerful vocal lines and melodies. “Body of Light’s” wider dynamic range takes the listener on an electrifying journey from dark, brooding passages through to full-tilt Heavy Metal glory.

Reverend Bizarre: Dark Sorceress (Autumn Siege),"Return to the Rectory 2005 Spikefarm Records
Finnish Doom Metal

Castle stands on the island of stone
It is surrounded by dark waters
Centuries on its place
For centuries more it shall do the same
Its history so cruel
The fort was cursed by eerie doom
There's a witch enclosed into the wall
No one knows exact place where
There's a tree on the wall
More than thirty feet tall
It is said its roots
Grew from the heart of sorceress
Every night she haunts
On the corridors of fort
Her restless soul
Wanders in those huge halls

Autumn long time ago
The colossal stone fort
Inside that dark walled castle
Beautiful young female dwelt

Dark Sorceress, daughter of the castle lord
Dark Sorceress, worshiper of the Ramlord

Dark witch used black magic
Gestic magic in the war
In war against warriors
Wielders of the curved sabres

Dark Sorceress, daughter of the castle lord
Dark Sorceress, worshiper of the Ramlord

Another stormy night during that autumn of fights
The enemy broke the gates and came with their sharp blades
Sorceress casted the spell to protect the castle
She performed her rite against intruders with sabres

Sky turned to dark
The sorceress drew the mark
Mark of the Ramlord in the air
Strongest thunderstorm was created
Lightning's everywhere
Electricity in the air
Lightning casted the shadow
Of the Ramlord onto the wall
Enemy saw that shape
And because of that they escaped
The shadow of the Ramlord
On the wall of black powered fort
(Behold) Dark Sorceress, daughter of the castle lord
(Hark) Dark Sorceress, worshiper of the Ramlord...!

☩ ☩ ☩

The Ship of Stone

[In lost spheres the trifold vortex brew 
As one: favourable illusions 
Tearing down as four angles 
Delusions may escape once again 

From a point a line 
from a line a surface 
From a surface the seas 
Through the vortical cross the death is spread] 

Open the gates 
Diffuse the breach of being 
Turn the seas 
Down to the frozen womb 

Sinking in the currents of abyssal hymns 
Pouring as a thickness of dreams 

The dark stream of cold water 
Squeezed into echoes and shapes 
Of circulating current beneath 
All from the same river mouth 

A crescentic boat is sailing 
In the valleys of the deepest well 
Carrying the rays of the Sun 
The patterns of depth's slumbering arts 

The Stone bell of doom 
The Doom bell of stone 
The coiling of the abyssal depth 

The coiling of the circles 
From which the weird is woven 
The dreamer's gate 
Pulsing through 

Following the shape of the black bird 
Guided above the night fog 
On the long path of the grave-fish 
All the threads must be known 

Above coniferous castles 
And the graves of the old 
The vortex evolves further 
As the ship of stone 

An ellipse with a dragon-like face 
Eyes see through the star ice cold 

Coated by the equinoxial night 
The wind salutes that sculpture 
The carvings which tend the stars 
Spiraling devotion 

Highest octaves of the winged sun 
Gather around the presence of the purple maid 
As the shoreless night floods upon 
Under of the turned seas 
Coniferous shadows whistle no more 

Serpentine motions, a presence so strong 
Oh, the fine worlds behind revealed 
Floating on the moulting fields 
In the rhythm of a geometrical sway 

Construction reflecting the structure of the universe 
The womb and the grave 
Navigated by the golden temple 
In the sea the fire should be found 

Ethereal vapours of strange light 
Dissolving away time and space 
Summoned by the crystal gate 
Countless eyes from the unspeakable planes 
Dissolving to the one... 

The continents melting to liquid 
Soaring up as mist 
The limits of space immense 
Are covered by stonen scales 

In the light of stones in the ring of dimensions 
Sounding the sea of endless space 
By the secrets of the purple maid 
Withdrawing within eternity

☩ ☩ ☩

The Crooked Tree

Above the dimness of woods I wonder 
The boundaries of earth and sky 
The silence of this ever-burning grave 
Gazing the journey of the celestial bodies 

And how those distant fires carved their signs 
On the surface of the seas 
Reflections of the weight of the stars around 
Outlined against ambient serenity 

Thus rose the windy tree from thin air 
The revelation of the nightly shadow 
To rise from the rock 
To reach out towards the pole star 

Hear the chants from behind the waters 
When lines thicken drawn by the primeval light 
The angles of the transcendent current 
Woven by the depths of space 

The orbits and chords of stars assemble thousandfold 
As leaves around the abysmal stem 
The vibrant forms gather as a multi-dimensonal vision 
Ascending like the lily of the waters 

Thus rose the windy tree from thin air 
The revelation of the nightly shadow 
To gather from the rock 
Summoned by the eyes of the sky 

Like language is the tone of that flowery fir 
Its words as if spread by the wind 
Dim bewitching tongue from it's branches 
The pulse from beyond the stars 

Thus introduced the tree itself in the northwind 
Reciting it's name: the number of stars 
The one who absorbs from the deepest well 
From the depths of the unknown 

""Secrets of beingness, 
The hope of men 
Lies in the abyss 
'i' is the way, throughout the eight"" 

To learn from the branches and leaves 
He rose to the tree of shadows 
Whose words are pronounced by the wind 

Nights in the grasp of branches 
Left foot spelling the fullness of space 
The sentiments of the hanged 
The centrifugal melody 

Along the spear's shaft 
I saw through the gates of death 
On the heart blood-dyed steed 
Swaying in the wind 

Hanging as a corpse 
I listened to the river's bed 
Noted the great sea-serpent 
From the signs on it's scales 
I fathomed it's true length 

The fermentation of the serpentine waters I hear 
The sights of the branches and leaves 
The principles of the phonetic foundation of space 
The entity of Being 

In the middle of the pitch-black sea 
I settled down 
Embraced the star abstractions 
To coil through the knotholes 

Steady, calm & tight 
I fall into the night 

”On that tree 
No man knoweth 
The roots beneath its growth”

CBS: 70's Turkish Anatolian Rock Vinyl Set,"All music rights belong to their rightful owners. Please support the musicians and buy their music.

7th episode of the series called Coffee Break Sessions (CBS).
I played most of these records before, in the Turkish Anatolian Pop & Rock Ep 1-2-3-4 and 5. All of those videos are now blocked. 
So I thought, maybe it's a good idea to make a new one -without the ones that aren't available for use on Youtube. I played a few new records that I have. 

This episode is only Anatolian Rock records during the 1970s. I hope this new one will survive. The only reason why Baris Manco is not in this video is simply because of the copyright issues:( 
Hope you enjoy.

This is the fourth episode of the Sunday Brunch Sessions with the support of Yemeksepeti Banabi! Since this channel doesn't make any money out of Youtube and ads, it's very vital for us to get support from brands. So, thank you Yemeksepeti Banabi. They are a Turkish online food delivery company providing the facility to place food orders online from an affiliated network of restaurants without charging the user any extra fees.

I made an episode of Turkish Female Singers back in August 2019 and the reaction from you was very positive. So I decided to make a new one. All records originally released in the '70s. I tried to pick my favorites but I must say there are tons of more records that didn't make it in the mix. Hopefully, I can make a third one in the future! In this mix, you will find some legends like Selda, Gulden Karabocek, Tulay, Seyyal Taner, and many more!

The Music of Despair

In the loneliness of winter
When I seek penance for my sins
I call upon my fate for mercy
Oh, let the king of diamonds win

When the lords of light are with me
I climb the stairs up to Ungol
When the angel witch she soothes me
I'm her witchfinder general

Doom is the soul of metal
Primordial and pure
Doom is the true essence of living
Immortal
My cure

When my heart is filled with sorrow
And I wonder who I am
I put on some ancient Trouble
Some old Vitus, Pentagram

When my soul walks in the darkness
Or life's hopelessness again
Then I find solace
I find comfort
And I learn and understand

At the blessed pagan altar
He kneels the reverend bizarre
And he calls me and I follow
Into the doomed world of my heart

There is beauty in the mourning
So much truth and tenderness
Let me celebrate the sabbath so black
The rites of candlemass

There is wisdom in the slowness
In the rhythm is the magic
In the air
And I know I've found salvation
In the music of despair

The Rotting Trophy

Suck the blood from my veins
Cut me down, desecrate my grave

Bleed me dry and burn my skin
Grind my bones, let the journey begin

Like an empty vessel
Desolate
You have it now
But my spirit reigns again

Now, you down!
The tide has changed
There is no way out
You are gonna pay

In my destination
There is no use for hands
The secrets of that world
The eyes cannot see
In the comfort of my earthly grave
Lies the rotting trophy
Of your shallow victory

I let the worms devour my flesh
I am done with this planet's bloody mess

When the Wind Howled with a Human Voice

People standing silently
Staring at the sky
The colours are gathering
Suffering trees sigh
There is no one to warn them now
No one to raise his voice
The shadow is passing by
All that is living is starting to die

The May rain will fall
The end of it all
The end of the world

Buried under the ruins of the city
Burnt by the shattering sun
The failure of the creation
The end has begun
Drifting in the river of life
Polluted by the human hand
The shadow passes by
No one left to stand

The May rain will fall
The end of it all

Nature cries, the view is shivering
Air is too heavy to breathe
Trees dance in anxiety
A civilization too proud
The concrete jungle collapsing, falling to dust
The angels of the blind god laughing
The lesson of Babylon forgotten centuries ago

Ears are bleeding
Under the waves of unbearable noise
Nature cries
The wind howls with a human voice

People standing silently
Staring at the sky
The colours there gathering
It's time to say goodbye
The end

The God Behind the God

Passionate onanists standing under the crucifix
The Heavens are pouring tears for the nailed one
A wall of flesh is build with human bricks
When the demiurge reigns supreme the true god is done

The false prophets of the Old Testament vomiting a thousand lies
Man-made rules tied together with the saviour's blood
But the ones within the truth are opening their eyes
Fearlessly encountering the god behind the god

Sacred names printed with gold on black parchments
Truth decoded from meaningless paraphrases
Underground sects performing pure sacraments
Summoning the hermaphrodite god of multiple faces

The children of Bethlehem are buried under the mourner's bench
But their souls dance high above in the Heavenly hall
Transcendental flowers cover the profane stench
At the feet of the Pharisees the Earth-bound maggots crawl

”Now when the heavens had consolidated
themselves along with their forces and all their
administration, the prime parent became insolent.
And he was honored by all the army of angels. And all
the gods and their angels gave blessing and honor to
him. And for his part, he was delighted and continually
boasted, saying to them,

”I have no need of anyone.” He said, ”It is I who am
God, and there is no other one that exists apart from
me. I will go before thee, and make the crooked places
straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and
cut in sunder the bars of iron.

And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and
hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest
know that I, the Lord, which call thee by thy name, am
the God of Israel.

I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no god
beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known
me.

That they may know from the rising of the sun, and
from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the
Lord, and there is none else.

I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace,
and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.

I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous god, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation of them that hate me.”

And when he said this, he sinned against all the
immortal beings who give answer. And they laid it to
his charge.

Then when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler,
she was filled with anger. She was invisible. She said,
”You are mistaken, Samael,” (that is, ”blind god”).
”There is an immortal man of light who has been in
existence before you, and who will appear among
your modeled forms; he will trample you to scorn,
just as potter’s clay is pounded. And you will descend
to your mother, the abyss, along with those that
belong to you.

For at the consummation of your works, the entire
defect that has become visible out of the truth will be
abolished, and it will cease to be, and will be like what
has never been.”

It has been many years since I composed these songs. They came to me in the dark, these words and simple melodies, recited endlessly in my mind as I sat imprisoned in the darkness of isolation in His Majesty’s dungeon without quill or parchment for a crime of which I was, unfortunately, most guilty. Had I not pushed the boundaries of reality in a vain attempt to conquer Death itself, had I not unleashed hideous powers upon the kingdom that caused so much pain and destruction, had I not inflicted upon myself what may be the ultimate curse, had I not done these things I would be sleeping peacefully in the senseless, interminable abyss of nothingness and my name would be revered throughout history as a legendary sorceror. Alas, I did cause these events to unfold and nothing can change that now. His Majesty has been dead for nearly a century, yet I live on, shunned by the world, living secretly in the dark forests of the north until time ceases to exist. There are times when I question if this is truly reality, I wonder if I ever did return from the mind palace of the Mushroom God, that strange and terrible realm of imagination which I was so careless, nay, foolish, to invoke. No matter how I strive to avoid it, I inevitably catch a fleeting glimpse of myself in the dark forest stream and see the ghostly bones of my face and know it is real. I shudder in fear and disgust to think of my encounter with Orcus, immortal Lord of the Underworld and now my master, forever, until he sees fit to release me from my necromantic servitude.

Ascending

A dark disease
Choking us slow
We go in a row
Down towards the abyss
But few chosen
Know the solution
They hold the key to
Ascending from pestilence
Rise, now, die, now

Road to the Fire

I travel, on a road
In the eye, reflects a burning… horizon
Road to thee, fire
Road to thee, fire
The dust, behind me
Remains in, forgotten… memories
Road to thee, fire
Road to thee, fire
Devoured by the flames

Eat the Sun

Fly away
To eat the sun
Without knowledge
The sun
Is burning
And so you do
The ash falls
Everything…
Becomes darker
The sun
Is drowned in
A dark jaw
So it will be for you who ate the sun

Eternal Sleepwalker

He is the one
That slowly wraps his robe
Like a shadow
Over this doomed world
Eternal sleepwalker
He is the one
Who watches over the sleeping
The mass of drones
Beyond redemption
Eternal sleepwalker
Thousands living dead
Asleep while they eat their bread

Ancient Days - Black Widow \ Black Widow - In Ancient Days (1970),"“We’re humbled, honored, and stoked to be able to share a split with Black Widow.
We’ve been talking to Kip Trevor for a couple weeks now. So we mentioned doing something like this to show homage to a band where we got our name “ancient days” from. He was into it and so here we are. Maybe we’ll be lucky enough to released on record.” - Ancient Days

ILLUSIONS UNDER THE SUN by BLACK MOON MOTHER

--------------------------------------------------------------------

LOST IN THE MAZE

Mother of mine
Father of time
They say heavens above
More like hell on earth

Enter the maze
Try to find your way
No beginning or end
My traveling friend

Center of the maze
Labyrinth for days

Hide away, hide, hide away, from it
Fall away, fall, fall away

Lost in the maze
Lose in the maze

Hide away, hide, hide away, from it
Fall away, fall, fall away

Lost in the maze
Lost in the maze

You’ll find a way out of here
You’ll find a way out

Lost in the maze
My traveling friend

--------------------------------------------------------------------

AROUND THE FINGER

Slippin’ away
Slip, slather, slink
Cheat of the day
It really makes you think
Trippin’ to stay
Now you’re around the finger

Around the finger
Slip away
Around the finger

Aware of decay
When time slows it sinks
Drip into shape
There never was a ring
Freedom in fate
Now you’re around the finger

Around the finger
Slip away
Around the finger

Forever the weight
Inside you know it stings
Child at play
She taught you everything
Grippin’ your face

Slip away, slip away

Around the finger
Slip away
Around the finger
Slip away

--------------------------------------------------------------------

HIGH WINDS

Ancient ones are waiting
Underneath they’re saving
All their light
Packed deep inside
We must search
Every living being
Earth and tree and seedling
For golden spark
Light in the dark

High winds fall
On us now

Intricately waving
Celebrating craving
The other side
Watch your mind
In we go
Every little facet
Glistens with the habit
Right between the eyes
Timeless time

High winds fall
On us now

Always moving on
Riding toward the sun

Look, it's in the water
It’s in the wood
It’s drifting into space
Along the way
Pieces will stay

Wander, out of the fodder
Just like a child
With curiosity
Along the way
Pieces will stay

Dispel the myth
Embrace the lift
In heavy times
The flame is alive

Always moving
Onward on
Riding toward that setting sun

--------------------------------------------------------------------

SLOW DOWN

The others that live too deep in
Feel the strain of truth and whim

Here we are, we’re alive, one

Slow down
Two hands on the ground
Feel the air we breath

Here we are, we’re alive, one

Slow down
Two hands on the ground
Feel the air we breath

High, Higher

--------------------------------------------------------------------

RADIANT SUN

Where will we go when time is done and all we know is gone?
Radiant sun, soil is blood, you were all we knew

Radiant sun
You were the one who made all the fun
Oh radiant sun

Creation is blood
Soil is mud
We knew not of your worth
But you were the one who made all the fun
And now all we’ve got is “sorry”

We’re so sorry

Radiant sun

This is the second episode of the new mini series called Portable Sessions. During the summertime visit to my home city Istanbul, I decided to take a pair of portable turntables with me, and record a vinyl set episode with some amazing views in different parts of the country. My second stop is Ovacik, in Cesme/Izmir.
Because I live in London, whenever I get a chance to visit home in Turkey, I try to buy as much Turkish records (mostly 45's) as I can. And this time was no exception. In this portable session, I am playing some of to hardest to find records from Feride, Mogollar, Deniz Erkanat, Dario Moreno, Ferdi Ozbegen and more.

Special thanks to Ali, Banu and Alya Kanibelli.

Big shout out to Yemeksepeti Banabi, who's supporting this series! Since this channel doesn't make any money out of Youtube and ads when it comes to vinyl set episodes, it's very vital for us to get support from brands. So, thank you Yemeksepeti Banabi.

It took a lot of hard work and a few cast changes to get this together. Evan, our guitarist and vocalist, had been traveling the USA from New Orleans to Oregon and everywhere in-between, hitch-hiking and even hopping the occasional freight-train, trying to make something happen. At first, we met up in Texas under the name Maenad but were again torn apart. Finally, we all locked ourselves in a basement studio at AMP rehearsal studios in LA to flesh out the bones of this first album.

It sounds exactly like what it is: the combined frustration, hatred, depravity, and despair that came from years of dredging the gutters, drug dens and 5 dollar shows across the USA for something meaningful, something real.

We are Somnus Throne and we are from all over the USA.

Curse of The Pharaoh

Beneath the ashes of titan
Lies death sacred past
Icy smoke seeking refuge
Dune escape desert vast

Forever lost in the ocean
Sonic wasteland awaits
As he passes the awaken
Frozen hand frees the gate

Burying the forsaken
Night death-cast awake
Left to waste in oblivion
Temple space desiccate

River serpent of chaos
Desert sun now extinct
As he rises to the apex
Sky now black-obsidian

Into the City of the Dead
Come Day of Judgment, we descend
From birth to exile, at his command
Forever cursed to walk this land

Hope grows narrow
Under the curse of the pharaoh
The path turned narrow
Undying curse of the pharaoh

Scold's Bridle

Immense decay, you’ll suffer
You’re on your own
Beneath a blood moon sky

Creeping death before you
There’s no escape
Beyond the Holy land

Come ancient rhyme of sorrow
Calling from the void
Embrace the astral plane

Come forth heathen spirit
Master of deceit
Dethroned, up in flames

Conceptual obsession
Nocturnal sacrifice
Into the valley of shadows
Oh Lord, please take my hand

Perceptual discarnation
Infernal majesty
Bearing a crown of horns
The scold’s bridle ripped and torn

Eye of Doom is a progressive doom metal trio which combines traditional fuzz-driven stoner/doom with progressive and space rock elements from the ‘70s to evoke a unique and interesting sound. With dimensions reaching far beyond the sonic soundscapes typically found within the genre, Eye of Doom explores uncharted territory.

The riff-moulding for Curse of the Pharaoh was produced and recorded by the band in early 2020. The songs on this EP draw inspiration from the grand scenery found in the towering mountain ranges and vast forests of the band’s hometown, as well as exploring existential questions connected to topics such as mysticism, astronomy, paganism, and the occult.

Devour the Dead

All your deeds lie in judgment all your pleas will be heard
Scales of justice weigh your fate
Salivating jaws await
She is three beasts of one flesh, demigod with no throne
Bound to serve out the ages, she devours hearts of stone
Scales of justice weigh your fate
Salivating jaws await
Days of mercy like bones to dust
Come forth thieves and liars
Your time has grown dire
Tomb of heavy hearts, tearing souls apart
The devoured, the divine
Feast upon our eyes
Evil cannot hide
We will judge you all
Pray the feather falls
Your salvation or your doom
Life eternal or your tomb
The devoured, the divine
Your salvation or your doom
Life eternal or your tomb
Now the beast grows impatient
Judges settle your score
Feather soars to the heavens
Your heart sinks to the floor
Scales of justice seal your fate
Salivating jaws await
Days of mercy like bones to dust

🕈 🕈 🕈

Through Divine Rite

The embers have grown cold
In our barren stronghold
We grow weary as the sun escapes the sky
Days ago down below
Lost dominion to our foes
They await the scythe to cleanse us from the Earth
Like razors to the flesh
Down the vines to certain death
We die free
Through divine rite
We descend into the black
We may never come back
We die free
Through divine rite
We’ve been shackled from the womb
Lived our lives like men entombed
Subjugated under heel and bloody lash
And we toiled with sword in hand
Spilling blood on Roman sands
We’re a waking viper coiled around their necks
Like razors to the flesh
Down the vines to certain death
We die free
Through divine rite
We descend into the black
We may never come back
We die free
Through divine rite
Rise! We are fury, we’re the end
Their backs are exposed as we descend
Rush - decimate their legionnaires
Flay - open flesh, no one is spared
Loose the arrows, charge the wall
Before they sound the battle call
Seize trebuchet and Roman steel
Time for imperials to kneel
No time to mourn what we have lost
Our freedom comes at such a cost
Make them beg us for their lives
No quarter! No one will survive

🕈 🕈 🕈

Trampled into the Earth

They come forth the vanguard of doom
Vast as sight their banners of war
Hear them sound their Clarion horn
Trampled into the earth!
Scarlet flames reach into the sky
Choking embers blot out the sun
Oh our cities razed ash
Trampled into the earth
Ruin has come for us all
Steel on steel, burial ground
Under their venomous gaze
Visions of darkness, are visions no more!
A plague to rob you of breath
Behold the bringer of death
Of death
Of death
Their death a stain on our soul
Steel on steel! Blood, it shall flow
Clawing our way to the grave
Vanquished lie dead, trophied remains!
Until there’s no one left
Behold the bringer of death
Death
Ravens feasting upon their bones
Skulls piled high like mountains of stones
Soon their hunger rises again
Trampled into the earth!

🕈 🕈 🕈

Two Coins for the Ferryman

You’ve come from afar
Thread cut from the skein
You dare to tread here
Where all must come clean
You can take your soul
Leave the rest ashore
Take your soul
All your weight must go
This skiff has seen finer days
The ages haven’t been kind
If you weigh her down
You’ll be lost for all time
You can take your soul
Leave the rest ashore
Take your soul
All your weight must go
A pauper bearing empty hands
A king with riches and demands
A warrior’s medals and his fame
Just clear the gangway of those claims
A seer bringing words of dread
A courtesan adorned in red
A politician and his lies
Will surely make us all capsize
We sail down the Styx
We’re destined for home
Eternity waits
This life all I’ve known
You can take your soul
Leave the rest ashore
Take your soul
All your weight must go
You can take your soul (two coins for the ferryman)
Leave the rest ashore (two coins for the ferryman)
Take your soul (two coins for the ferryman)
All your weight must go (two coins for the ferryman)
Once battle scarred
Now spineless men
All greed and power
Indifference
Let it go!

Cardinal Fuzz and Little Cloud Records are delighted to bring to you for your listening pleasure – Alien Mustangs – ‘Beat Of The Earth’.
Emanating sonically (and physically) from Thessaloniki, Greece, the band has been crafting its unique blend of '60s-flavored, hypnotic, space-psych trippiness since 2013, releasing their debut LP ""Alienation"" in 2018 (on the always great Sound Effect Records) - this follow up 'Beat Of The Earth' is a shimmering wash of the most lysergic, cosmic and melodic music to have reached out ears so far in 2020.
Their mutant psych / space hybrid is deeply rooted in sixties garage, and while still paying tribute to their influences,(((Loop))), Spacemen 3, The 13th Floor Elevators and The Stooges, ‘Beat Of The Earth’ has a Teutonic beauty that brings to mind Harmonia.
Opening tracks ‘Sound Of No Future’ and ‘Fairy Meadows’ are both super- kosmische space rock epics where Alien Mustangs create an alluring, thick miasma that practically invites you to lose your bearings in their incandescent, the hallucinogenic cosmic glory.
On the flip over and we get Alien Mustangs in a fuzzed up Stooges pounding strung out guitar grind, where tidal waves of guitar drones detonate in your mind, Hawkwind inspired freak flag wildness flies with an added dose of motoric krautadelia. ‘Beat Of The Earth touches down gently with he lilting ‘Waiting The Dawn’ – a track that shimmers and glides with serene beauty as you melt blissfully into the ether of its serene beauty.
Beat of The Earth is presented to you in a 350gsm Sleeve and pressed on Ltd Galaxy Yellow marble Vinyl and Black Vinyl.

Flower of Revelation

Are you staring at me?
Looking for, I don't know what
Behold, the long awaited flower
As the dazzling revelation strikes

No one knows where it can drive us
Behold, the end before the end
I possess the knowledge
to see...

What I want it's just to beat
Bloodshot eyes and an axe in my hands
Because the world comes to an end
This is what I think I' m seeing

We are staring at the horizon
From the highest mountain peak
You already knew I' m the chosen one
I accepted my fate

No one knows where it can drive us
Behold, the end before the end
I possess the knowledge
to see...

What I have chosen is clear
A one way path to a bloody death
Looking for salvation
With the flower of revelation

Family Curse inspired by House of Usher (1960) 
☠️ ☠️ ☠️

A hatred curse runs in our family
Spreading like ashes with the wind
It would reach the outer world
If I opened my chamber door

For hundreds of years
We've dwelled on these plains
Where the thick mist always lays
Covering this house that we're in
Dark windows and pale brick walls

Slayers and rapers, maniac stalkers
Sleep in my basement tomb
The caskets are set for her and me
Though our souls will be never set free...

Our family's scarred in so many ways
All torments a man may gain
We've suffered in silence, yet still aware
Proud of who we once were

Slayers and rapers, maniac stalkers
Sleep in my basement tomb
The caskets are set for her and me
Though our souls will be never set free...

As the years roll by we will stay the same
Godless hands once built this grave
Where death and darkness reign

""My eyes are tormented by all
but the faintest illumination.
Odours assail me constantly.
And, as I've said, sounds of any degree
whatsoever inspire me with terror.

That's why I had to remove my boots.

Yes. And even so, I could hear your coming.
Every footstep, every rustle of your clothes.
I could hear your horse approaching, the
clatter of its hooves across the courtyard,
your knock... The grating of the door bolt
was like a sword stroke to my ears.
I can hear the scratch of rat claws
within the stone wall.""

Now as I stand here alone, I weep
Remembering the good old days
I'm cursing the gods who made my family
Fester in such horrible ways

Yet burnt out is the flame of life
Black house falls into smoke
Still on its last faint breath protecting
Secrets of Usher's name

No more left
I beg for death
Its red eye glows
It takes me beyond

Visiting Castle Hedingham in Essex in 2016, gave Dave the idea of what to call his new recording project.
Trebuchet, a huge medieval sling, in which objects are catapulted.
It gave an imagary, perfect for what he was trying to achieve musically. Total chaos!!! Well, not quite, but a nod back to the bands who did their own thing, back when heavy rock was in its infancy.
That's exactly Trebuchet.

Originally, this project was going to be a a vehicle for Dave to hone his production skills. However, although that is still true (Dave engineers the whole thing), Trebuchet has become a very important project.
Trebuchet has turned into something completely different as first planned. Not a side project at all, but a full on new project which the guys hope will last forever, as they are having a blast working together.
They, meaning Dave Gilbert (Dark Matter and Minor Planet) and Shayne Joseph (Eldritch Rites).
To cut a long story short, the guys met online and became firm buddies through the power of technology.
It all happened, when Dave was asked to record the vocalists voice, for the debut album by Open Door Of Doom. Australian band Eldritch Rites (Melbourne) supplied the music. Shayne is their guitarist, vocalist and main writer.
Many conversations confirmed Dave and Shayne had so much in common musically and became good friends online.
Dave decided to ask Shayne if he'd like to join him for the ride in Trebuchet. It seemed a no brainer.

In the Spring of 2017, two brothers began an undertaking that would lead them into complete exile over a period of 2 ½ years.  The sonic vision that became Marble Eye, is the true debut album of Alex and Nick Greywitt of Tyranonaut from Rochester, NY.  Self-financed and self-released under their own label, Hopkins and Stearne Productions, Marble Eye is the amalgamation of the brothers’ ideals of what an album, an invaluable treasure frozen in time, should encapsulate while demanding “active listening,” as penned by the band.

Witchfinder General, Black Sabbath, Witchfynde, Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Trouble, Pagan Altar, Nazareth, Angel Witch, Jaguar, Satan, Desolation Angels, Hawkwind, Poison (Germany), Jethro Tull, old Genesis, King Crimson, Budgie, Captain Beyond, Black Hole, Celtic Frost, Candlemass/Nemesis, Cloven Hoof, Dream Death/Penance, The Sisters of Mercy and countless others were among utmost importance during this time to create a heavy album with its own sonic identification and concepts. 
*
The Hermetic mindset during this time birthed 5 songs spanning 52 minutes which we are proud to finally release via 666MrDoom’s channel. A limited edition of 250 vinyl copies are available for pre-order, which the band considers to be the ultimate incarnation and realization of their 3 year vision. The gatefold release will come with a 12” vinyl, 7” vinyl, 16x24” high quality promo poster with full artwork, and double sided insert with extensive liner notes.  The vinyl contains a special mastering completed by Jim Plotkin, differing from the digital master heard here.  
Until then, future eyewitness of those days…a thousand days of yesterday are time since come and gone. Our penance is paid.

Forever Amongst the Ruins

Dark shadows fall
As the wind blows upon
Towering monuments
Of broken memories

And I am left alone
To wander in what once was
Splendor in my mortal eyes
This life I used to call divine

Where are they now
The truths I took for granted
The light of a thousand suns
Now only dust remains

Will you now reach for me?
Dark endless eternity
Take me away from this life
Into a new beginning

I call upon the lords of time
To break the bonds of false eternity
This place of black illusion I must escape
I am not a child of this reality

Dark shadows fall
As the wind blows upon
Towering monuments
Of broken memories

Will you now reach for me?
Dark endless eternity
Take me away from this life
Into a new beginning

I call upon the lords of time
To break the bonds of false eternity
This place of black illusion I must escape
I am not a child of this reality

A deafening echo that suddenly speaks out of the dust, conveying all the desolation of an endless landscape up to the sky.
A journey for those who like exotic rock to sound viscerally loud, raw and high gained. To blow up the speakers for good. Fuzzed guitar and Buzzing didgeridoo locked with a sped up drums and cranked bass sound that makes you feel like you are riding a spacecraft at full speed between the dunes.
KARKARA's second album, ""Nowhere land"" explores the mysteries of the unknown lands. An album that drags the comfort out of your zone and creates an eerie space of atmospheric low-end and sneering highs.
 ----
7 tracks that take a further step into a dark and mystical world.
This album is a straight continuity of 'Crystal Gazer'. The second chapter of a journey made by a traveler who discovers new lands and mysterious people.
Written during Crystal Gazer's tours, among long rides between gigs and rehearsals in south France. Recorded in Toulouse at SwampLand studio and using only analog equipements to add that raw Lo-fi flavor they love.
----
Created in 2017 in Toulouse, France, the threesome takes it's inspiration among different rock genre, from the sweet middle eastern psychedelic rock to the raw shattering sounds of garage fuzz and german krautrock.
Even going so far as to use their favorite atypical instrument - the didgeridoo - the three members of KARKARA, like desert wizards, take pleasure in pushing further the boundaries of the genre and take their audience into a mystical and indomitable world.
----
Their debut album «Crystal Gazer», released in October 2019 through Stolen Body Records (UK) and the french cassette label Ghost Lizard Diffusion, is a hypnotic musical production inspired by the mystical folklores all around the middle eastern countries. With the collaboration of the illustrator Dead Flag who was an additional source of imagination, this 7 tracks LP of 41 minutes is a deafening psychedelic flood where the desert and the tribal atmosphere is omnipresent. The lyrics take the form of mystical and narrative incantations that draw the thread of an epic journey that unfolds throughout the album.

Tales From The Crypt

The darkness, the fear, the silence, squeeze
My body, my arms, my legs, my mind keep
Remembers feelings, emotions, and now I am
I’m an old man, I’m alone and my friends are dead

The fear of death down, down, down in the crypt
I hide my name, my fear, my soul, the bloody eyes
Fire, fire, I feel this pain, but all are dead now, all are dead now

It’s late for lamentations, they are looking me now
I have to run to the dark woods
Crossing the threshold and finding the light

The fear of death down, down, down in the crypt
I hide my name, my fear, my soul, the bloody eyes
Fire, fire, I feel this pain, but all are dead now, all are dead now

My heart is beating and I see a shadow
He call my dead name, he call my dead name…

Some of you may remember, I shared a photo on Instagram that teases the idea of making a set dedicated to the oud masters a few months ago. Now it's finally completed! The result doesn't feel nor sound like a usual Coffee Break Sessions episode, that's why I decided not to put CBS in the title.

It's a bit of a risky episode; people might hate it, some might love it, or some wouldn't even feel interested enough to click on it. But regardless, I feel happy with the result and decided to share it:)
Let me know your thoughts:)

Big thanks to my dear friend Mustafa Kaplan for shooting the intro sequence with his oud in his lovely Boston flat.

The undisputed champions of the middle eastern psych rock return with Transporter, their third album to date.

After 2 years trotting the globe and playing over 150 live shows, Ouzo Bazooka returned to the studio a tight knot radiating with ideas and inspiration to create what just might be their most cohesive work to date.

Suspiciously smelling like a mix of prohibited substances and powerful homebrewed potions, Transporter manages to effortlessly be a lot of things, that in a similar universe, contradict each other: it is psychedelic, but accessible. It is adventurous and creatively free spirited, but also filled with anthems waiting to be discovered, like the optimistic but mischievous It’s A Sin or Space Camel, the perfect soundtrack for your desert soul searching adventure. The sound is recognizable, but simultaneously an exception and expansion of the band’s creative palette.

Stylistically the album can be weighed for the sum of its parts; it is indebted to the Anatolian psych rock legends of the 70’s, crossbreeding with surf rock’s wildest moments and the sounds of the middle eastern ecosystem it sprang up from. But make no mistake, Transporter is its own beast - bursting with untamed creativity, refined songwriting, wild instrumentation and mind-bending, multi-layered production. 
There is a sense of discovery when listening to the album unfold. It channels humid back alleys and smokey dark clubs. Like gaining a backdoor VIP entrance to a forbidden, sweaty fuzz party where vails are removed, vices are tested and secret desires fulfilled. Filled with hidden jewels, the album is fun and surprisingly positive despite the density and weight of its grooves. First and foremost, it is a monument in Ouzo Bazooka’s sonic journey and an epic new chapter in the band’s story. 


Bio: 
Ouzo Bazooka was formed in Tel Aviv by Uri Brauner Kinrot, who grew up on the sunny shores of the mediterranean sea and has been active in the music scene for over a decade, shaping the sound of influential local groups as well as the critically acclaimed mediterranean surf band Boom Pam (currently collaborating with Turkish psychedelic-folk legend Selda Bağcan). 

Tel Aviv’s cultural diversity served as the perfect backdrop for Ouzo Bazooka’s formation and the maturing of their style; an exotic blend of middle eastern sounds and scales, moulded together with fuzzed psychedelic surf rock and garage. 

Following the release of their acclaimed self-titled debut album in 2014, the band was embraced by the local crowd and became somewhat of a local phenomena. It was only a matter of time before their sounds reached the European front and after a succession of high profile festival appearances, followed by two stellar releases, the media, critics and the international crowd took notice - the band’s position as the ambassadors of a new middle eastern rock sound was cemented.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lbtwle02g_g/maxresdefault.jpg,Ouzo Bazooka,4921,120,5,2702,45:02,"45 Minutes, 2 Seconds",2020-08-31T22:21:48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbtwle02g_g

''Our debut album came about during the 2020 Pandemics, recorded in Tunisia and Brazil, and 100% independently produced.

By pooling together inspirations from psychedelic ambient music, eastern/oriental influences, Jazz, Irish and Native American music, we celebrate the coming together of different cultures – all drawn to the same path of psychological awakening and enlightenment.

The album art, as well as our logo, was designed by our friend Sponte Sequor / @flowgunart ''

Acid Mammoth - Caravan (Full Album 2021),"GRAB YOUR COPY HERE:https://www.heavypsychsounds.com/shop.htm#HPS156
USA SHOP:https://www.heavypsychsounds.com/shop-usa.htm
“Caravan” is the band’s upcoming third full-length album. It is the direct successor to last year’s “Under Acid Hoof” and the fourth release of the band with Heavy Psych Sounds Records. It was conceived, recorded and produced during a state of total lockdown due to Covid-19, therefore it greatly reflects our mood during these dark times. It is a heavy, sublime and pitch black journey into the vast unknown. Like all of our previous works, “Caravan” was recorded, mixed and mastered with Dionysis Dimitrakos of Descent Studio in Athens, while drums were recorded at Ignite Studio. The artwork was once again crafted by Branca Studio. It is a witchy album for witchy ears, a heavy opus that has emerged straight from the deepest abyss. 
Once again the father and son duo on guitars offer the listener a horde of crushing, fuzzy, Iommi riffs while the mammoth bass tears down everything in its path with its acid hooves. Its drums are thundering unearthly beats of harrowing doom while its mesmerizing vocals will bewitch you with their words of woe. Heavier and more diverse than its predecessor, “Caravan” is here to tear you down with its acid tusks. Prepare to be doomed!!!

1782 - FromThe Graveyard (Full Album 2021),"GRAB YOUR COPY: https://www.heavypsychsounds.com 
USA SHOP: https://www.heavypsychsounds.com/shop-usa.htm 
""From The Graveyard"" is the second full length of the Occult Doom band ""1782"". In this album there is a leap in quality as the production is much better than the previous releases.
Eight tracks and 43 minutes of pure dark Doom, with slow and powerful riffs, and heavy and massive drumming.
After the recording of ""Doom Sessions Vol.2"", the band immediately enters the studio and records the heaviest tracks they have done so far, and they have done it while maintaining that catchy state they have always had. Here too there are featurings, Nico Sechi on organ (Hammond in ""1782"" and ""Celestial Voices"" in the debut album) and Alfredo Carboni's Synth.
As in the eponymous debut album, the artwork was done by the mighty SSCVLT.
""From The Graveyard"" was recorded, mixed and mastered in November 2020 by Alfredo Carboni at ""RKS Studios"" in Ossi, Sardinia (Italy).

Spatial environment, guided by reverberated guitars, straight drums almost in a loop, crooked melodies and shoe-gaze style voices. Shining melancholy our sound takes you to colorful landscapes, sometimes lucid, sometimes not. Take a walk through the garage of the '60s, and the post-punk of the '80s. He goes through acoustic ballads and the almost obscure frenzy.

15 years of psychedelic, occult doom, resounding with a singularity tight bond of chemistry and a haunting, faraway atmosphere as thick as a whale omelette.” Metal Hammer UK

""At once ominous, mysterious, and warmly
welcoming."" Doomed & Stoned (US)

“Spanish trio Kabbalah weave a certain
uneasiness into their surprisingly catchy strain of doomy psych rock.” Astral Noize (UK)

“A taut 29-minute/eight-song cultish mass,
thoroughly modern in melody and tonal presence, but given an edge of folkanalia just the same.” The Obelisk (US)

Dope Purple Grateful End is a far out psychedelic heavy space rock album in the vain of Acid Mothers Temple with wild experimental guitars, feedback, sci-fi synth sounds and explosive energy. This is a cosmic rocket ship that blast through the stars and lands on barren extraterrestrial landscapes. The guitars are forward in the mix and the drummer ramps up to light speed building incredible intensity and drive in the climatic sections of the album. Most of the songs run around 10 minutes in length for full freakout rock styling. Dope Purple Grateful End has echoing vocals that are literally buried in echo and reverb making them near indistinguishable. It adds to the psyched out atmosphere of the album and gives it an underground feel.
Dope Purple is from Taiwan and Grateful End is their first vinyl release. This album was first released in 2019 on cassette and CD. This new vinyl version has received a full remaster and sounds bigger and badder than ever.

LYRICS:
As the light creeps in the hall
And the dust mites wait to feed
The old black rat designs his palace
Nestled in amongst the filth
He gathers junk and useless things
Never straying from the deadline
With winter's clutch prolonged and death 'round the corner
The old black rat heals from the poison of disorder

Well I found a rat and cornered it
Yeah he was hiding in the shadows of my mind
And I felt the cold of winter on his back
And nothin' but sun light shining down upon his head",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7-sfe1Bhodg/sddefault.jpg,666MrDoom,6921,341,27,402,6:42,"6 Minutes, 42 Seconds",2021-04-26T08:00:03,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-sfe1Bhodg

I see through your eyes
Incarnation of insanity
A paralysis of human emotion
Realms of irreversality

An ethereal animation
Beyond the source of pain
Through cessation of life
Drowned in rivers of shame

A venture for redemption that dies in vain
Cries of ovation unleash your blame

You consummate an oath of misery
The path stretched by the fortitude of indignity
Now the penance for your guilt will show
Through the visions in thy shadow

Leave me... Deceive me

You lie naked persecuted
Beyond the scythe of death
Extreme unction, the beacon for your last breath
No sacred light to contour your way
The hollowness of faith fills the recesses of your prayer

A venture for redemption that dies in vain
Cries of ovation unleash your blame

A congregation bereaves the concealed answer
Prophecies on your corpse at the temple's altar
A burnt offering, a vestige that smoulders in haste
Through astral skies your soul still begs to elucidate

Heliosphere is a Canadian metal band based in Edmonton, Alberta. Formed in 2019, they began writing material almost immediately, taking advantage of the members’ varied musical backgrounds. They merge influences from 70s classic rock to contemporary metal to create a unique sonic brew, incorporating everything from cosmic, planet-hopping riffs inspired by the low ‘n slow doom greats to the soaring and driving vocals of the golden age of rock ‘n roll. In their debut single, Godhead, they combine these influences to great effect, resulting in a heavy-hitting juggernaut of a track sure to command the attention of the listener

Achachak - High Mountain (Full Album 2021),"Achachak is back with a brand new album! This time they are delivering 10 new & fresh tunes. Recorded and produced by brother Lem, at Cave Studio in Sinj; Croatia.
“High Mountain” has a monolithic force gluing guitars, drums and
bass all together to give the listener a punch in the face with a bag of weed and desert sand!
This album gets its high power from mixing together a 4x12 Orange amps with a doom-metal and stoner rock sound in a transcendental way. We can count a bunch of singles, such as “Mr. SM” and
“Lesson”, as well as a couple of fuzzodelic-doomy songs like
“Captain Morning” and “Lonewolf” and also more radio (un)friendly tunes like “Cozy Night” and “Maui Waui”.
This is the 2nd album of the band and we believe the best one so far.
This devilish baby is released by Dostava Zvuka Records.
The amazing artwork, made by the one and only Ivan Lampalov, thank you brother for drawing the scene we watch every morning.

Latin Influenced South East Asia with Norsicaa,"All music rights belong to their rightful owners. Please support the musicians and buy their music.
#vinylmix #latin #southeastasia

Norsicaa is playing South East Asian records that have a Latin music influence. What's more exciting is that she specially remastered and cut several records that she had which had surface noise and she felt deserved new life. After remastering, Norsicaa hand-cut 2 acetate dubplates using an analog Neumann VMS 70 vinyl cutting lathe!

Norsicaa's eclectic repertoire dates back to a musical upbringing. While versed in several music instruments, she eventually found DJing a satisfying outlet for her far-reaching taste - further expanded through working at Sounds of the Universe record store in Soho. Aside from Norsicaa's 4-weekly show on Soho Radio, she has contributed mixes to Stamp The Wax and Phonica Records, The Vinyl Factory and more. In summer 2019 she performed live on Boiler Room, supporting KOKOKO!. Amongst all this, she also runs daily operations as general manager for the respected independent record label, Soundway Records.

USA PRESALE:https://www.heavypsychsounds.com/shop-usa.htm 
=
Written throughout the 2020 global pandemic, Kadabra’s debut album “Ultra” presents an aesthetic that nears that “classic rock” charm and energy. The group has meshed together the droned flow of psychedelic clamor with an abrasive fuzzed riff drive. The sound is a mixture of psychedelic rock and hard rock riffing, vocals are choral and magnetic. In the fall of 2020, KADABRA enter the studio to record “Ultra” with producer Dawson Scholz : 7 brand new tracks for a fresh debut album: ULTRA keep the listener awake until the last minute of the album, with a variety of chill atmospheres. You can listen strong influences of Dead Meadow, Pentagram. One of the best albums in this 2021 so far !!

Records from Lebanon with Ernesto Chahoud,"All music rights belong to their rightful owners. Please support the musicians and buy their music.
#vinylmix #lebanon #middleeast

Ernesto Chahoud is a DJ, compiler, music researcher and radio host, with monthly shows on NTS, Totally Wired and Radio Alhara. He co-founded the Beirut Groove Collective, a decade-old vinyl DJ collective that runs one of Beirut’s hippest weekly parties, the BGC All-Nighter, where obscure 1960s and 1970s clubbing records from around the world can be heard. A serious record collector, Chahoud has one of the largest vinyl collections in the Middle East. Specializing in Arabic and Ethiopian music, his taste for little-known gems and obscure dancefloor stompers for his DJ box has taken him on digging trips around the world, from Addis Ababa to Cairo.

In this special guest mix, he's playing some of the rarest records from Lebanon.

Make sure to check out the compilation album with the tracks from Ethiopia’s seventies music scene, via BBE. Taitu: Soul-fuelled stompers from 1970s Ethiopia includes 25 tracks spanning r&b, rock, jazz, funk, and soul. The album which is divided into two parts – “Ethiopian soul clappers” and “Ethiopian soul stompers” – features well-known musicians, like “godfather of Ethio jazz” Mulatu Astatke and “Ethiopian Elvis” Alemayehu Eshete, alongside lesser-known artists.

For their eagerly anticipated follow up, Morieris, North Carolina duo Crystal Spiders bassist Brenna Leath (Lightning Born, The Hell No) and drummer Tradd Yancey (Doomsday Profit) take a lead guitar assist from Mike Dean (Corrosion of Conformity bassist and Leath’s bandmate in Ripple labelmates Lightning Born) for a rollercoaster ride of doomy atmospherics, razor sharp riffs, and infectious rhythms.

With their second offering, the band builds upon and refines the whiplash intensity of Molt to experiment with intricate harmonies, thundering breakdowns, and orchestral instrumentals (including guest cello from High Priestess Nighthawk of Heavy Temple). 2020 saw Crystal Spiders’ debut seated on many Album of the Year charts, and with Morieris, there’s no doubt that heavy music lovers will be saving a spot for them at the end of 2021 as well.

Only a year after recording their three-song demo and debuting live to a hometown crowd in Raleigh, the new band helmed by bassist Brenna Leath (Lightning Born) and drummer Tradd Yancey present their first riff-worshipping full-length, Molt. Pulling from classic rock dynamics and punk intensity, psychedelic textures and bluesy swing, this is a band hewn from the same granite as contemporaries like Heavy Temple and The Well, who build upon well-trod post-Sabbath templates to blaze their own path. With forthcoming appearances at Raleigh Deathfest and Maryland Doom Fest, it’s a safe bet that Crystal Spiders will soon demand the attention of the fuzz-addicted legions far and wide.

L'uom s'etterna

See the dying stars into a world of pain
Shadows of the past and memories of sadness
The dear, loving image, such as thine was
When so lately thou didst teach me the way
For man to win the eternity

See the souls who go mourning their endless doom!
Feel the cold of death into a world of sorrow
Under this rain of flames, memories of devotion:
...di voi quando nel mondo m'insegnavate come
L'uom s'etterna

I silence, I will find my control
The silence, thoughts of sadness and scorn
I fell into despair, I break the rules, I'm paying for my sins
The silence, follow me into my world
In silence! The eyes of torment and mourn
Lost in my despair, tell you of my anguish and my pain
I crossed the other side, my flesh is burning
I'm going out of my mind!

You can not save me from the rain of fire
Oh son! Sad he: I could talk with you
Questions haunt me
What will be left of my existence
The glory and eternity
The prolongation of pain and decay

Anger and patience, dreams of my desires
Darkness is falling, I'll see the light no more
Eternal perdition, souls of desperation
Forgiveness and sorrow, never-ending hellhole of regret!

In silence, I will find my control
The silence, brings me back into my world
I feel into despair, tell you of my anguish and my pain
I crossed the other side, my flesh is burning
I'm going out of my mind!
Lost in my despair

The silence, follow me into my world
In silence! The eyes of torment and mourn
I feel into despair, tell you of my anguish and my pain
I crossed the other side, my flesh is burning
I'm going out of my mind!
Lost my despair, I'm suffering into the eternal flames

♰ ♰ ♰

No Hope of Death

Through the gates of pain
Land of the wasted souls
Point of no return, stench of misery
Condemned to eternity
Leave any hope of death
Waiting for every man who fears no God

Voice of desperation
Inglorious existence
Screams of endless hate, tears of suffering
Legions of souls
Sinners with no remorse
They are forever lost in that black air of death

No forgiveness, no salvation for them
Resignation and pain
They have no hope of death
No hope for death

Visions of castigation
Malicious sounds of Hell
Accents of terror, words of blasphemy
Lost into eternal storm
Betrayers of the past
Eternal ways of pain, out of reality

No forgiveness, no salvation for them
Resignation and pain
They have no hope of death
No hope for death

The Great Refusal (Ignavus)

""Only etterne, and I eternal last!""
""through me the ways among the people lost""
Hard to understand, show me who they are!
Words of agony resounded
through the air without a star

Slaves of themselves, martyrs of the lies
Revelations, believers in disguise
Through this way we go, to the city dolent!
Holy sentence of the great refusal, he has no repent!

Hear the voice of souls into fetid plains of insanity
Evil eyes of perverse ecstasy

And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands
Ululations of despair across the lands
Reign of sadness, no infamy or praise
Horrid confusion, abandoned in disgrace
Rage and madness, here there's no innocent
Sacred torment of the great refusal, they have no repent!

Spells of imprecation, lost in squalid delight
Disgusting bedlam who were never alive
Miscreants and depraved of the futile identities
God's unwelcome and his enemies
...And his enemies

""Through me the way is to eternal dole""
Commingled with that unholy choir of the angel's fall
Expelled from the heavens, nor them the abyss receisves
For glory none the damned would have from them

Divine justice, languages of hate
Disdained and envious of every other fate
Through this way we go, to the city dolent!
Holy sentence of the great refusal, he has no repent!
No repent! No repent! No repent!

The Shadow Tower

In my darkest torment
tears of blood are falling in solitude
Anything is silence
and my pain is stronger than fear
I believe in nothing
and my eyes watch no more
Imprisoned in a shadow tower
my agony has just begun

I’m a ghost, I’m a dying presence
and my voice is strong no more
Into a noiseless sign of existence
my memories don’t want die

Time has gone so fast and I live the past
my life has passed away
Into ethereal trials of my reality
I breathe my pain

I cannot hear
I don’t want hear
what is the truth I need to know?

Veils of sadness
cover my loneliness
I swear, I’ll close my heart
I’ll not reveal my pain no more

My life of darkness
My tears of nothingness
my broken heart, my skin so cold

I don’t want hear
I have no fear
nobody knows my pain and I’ll not reveal it no more

I close my life

† † † 

Iniquitous Judgement

Eyes all around, voices from the unknown
Into darkness that's calling your name
You're turning back for despair, nothing to see
Quick is your breath, raises silent fear
You think cannot save you from your fate
Finders of soul wait for you, they judge for your sins

Thousand of words, thousand of thoughts
Explanations away from the pain
You try to react but your mind and your hands are unchained
You are alone, you are out of control
Deep inside you, a deafening silence
Accused for your vain existence, you are guilty to exist

Eyes of fate - endless time of pain
Eyes of clemency - lies in pain

Falling illusion, dark side of fate
Like a dreamless mind, there is no way
Hopeless eyes to your uncertain doom
Wait for ending of this inhuman torment
Your existence, your silent wait
All your authentic reasons descent
Hate inventors indict your soul
You know that is their iniquitous judgement

Eyes all around, voices from the unknown
Into darkness that's calling your name
You are turning back for despair, nothing you see
You are alone, you are out of control
Deep inside you, loud screaming of pain
You are judged and condemned to eternity

Rest in pain, without your faith
Your eyes are staring the emptiness
Eternal sleep, into depth of silence
Did you have a chance to seize the day?

Your hurts that bleed
And your hands are scared and cold
Your cry towards the nothingness
On my knees your face of sorrow
Time has gone don’t look back again

Wasted is the time to absolve your soul
Ashes to ashes, damnation! (Resignation!)
Fall into darkness expiate for your faults
Death is reality you’ve got it you know to exist
Lost is your reality forsake to eternal life*

No one answer
No one hope for human sin
It surrounds you …

... Deserted in a world of pain (you cannot see the end)
Surrounds you
Eternal life is not in your destiny

I close my eyes and I feel my sadness
So I really can to see
Where’re the things I’m pretending
I hold the frost of reality

A breath, my thoughts in contemplation
Scars and not healing hurts
Human faults, human creations
I make my world of dreams apart

All my of dreams of early life live again they’ll never die
As sweet touch of harmony
From the depth I hear a call it’s the voice of my soul
It’s a beautiful melody

I’m alive and I’ve got my mind control
I give my answers
True is my pain, my anxiety, my existence
I write my fate following my soul
Please forgive me I don’t see the end
Of that is not, it will be then

Trap of existence

My life is just begun I’ll forgive the suffered evil
I will pleased to give my real well
for a dying soul
Shall be done for me? Silent hope to tomorrow?
After the end I’ll know
Meaning of the death, from the depth of soul

Closed my eyes refuge of madness
To find the real mean to be
Image to mirrors of uniqueness
I discover in me my identity

Raging words of resignation
So I’m still in solitude
Human fault of isolation
I leave myself free to choose",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/d9xKUtwruIg/sddefault.jpg,† HOLY PARISH OF DOOM †,2160,42,1,1373,22:53,"22 Minutes, 53 Seconds",2016-09-15T11:52:15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xKUtwruIg

Castlevania - Bloody Tears (Stylophone cover),"If you want to give me a ""Double Like"", you can support me on Ko-fi:
https://ko-fi.com/maromaro1337

I love this song! Bloody Tears is my favorite Castlevania tune, with maybe Vampire Killer being second. Such a shame that it had to be presented in such a bad game. But still, the theme holds up to this day. You can even play with the chord progression and record an epic solo on it!

PS. It's Halloween!

"Tetris Theme ""Korobeiniki"" (Stylophone cover)","You can give me a ""double like"" on Ko-Fi!
https://ko-fi.com/maromaro1337

This is actually the A-Type music from the original Tetris (there are 3 songs - A,B,C). In reality it's a traditional Russian song called ""Korobeiniki"".
I did this one in the short and forgot to make a full video! So here it is! The game that's playing in the back is my take. I played the Gameboy original version. I'm not that good in Tetris, but this one was pretty neat.

Iron Maiden - Fear Of The Dark (Stylophone cover),"You can support me on Ko-fi
https://ko-fi.com/maromaro1337

Sorry it took so long but this track is over 7 minutes long! It was a blast making it, but damn - 4 minutes would be enough... But as you know, the cover must be perfect so yeah! Here's the whole song! The funny thing is that it wasn't even that hard. The Dual Stylophone main riff was a bit hard (the double tap one) and the bass part was pretty tight. Steve Harris is a beast!

Black Sabbath - Iron Man (Stylophone cover w/ solos),"You can support me on Ko-fi
https://ko-fi.com/maromaro1337

This one took longer then expected, because:
1) This song is almost 6 minutes long!
2) Every 4-8 bars there is a tempo change
3) The solos are horrible to play on the Stylophone
So sorry for the wait, but as you can see it was not easy. Aside from that I still had some fun while doing it!

Special Keep It True Rising - Heavy Metal Universe XVII,"Keep It True Festival is finally back after 1,5 years! It has been deeply missed even though I only went there once in the latest edition held in 2019. Like I always say: ""Go to  Keep It True one time and you're hooked for life"". To celebrate the RISING return of the festival, I created a playlist featuring all the bands that will play in Würzburg on November 19-20. 

Hope you like this episode either you're attending the fest or not. If you are, see you there. If not, hope to meet you there in the future.

You’ve heard of the necromancer and those who communicate with the dead, but how about the necronaut? The name alone assumes the ability to travel to places near and far throughout time via the rocky, untested waters of “death travel.” 
The band illuminates the backstory of The Necronaut for us thusly: “An imperious and vengeful dead King is brought back to life with a thirst for carnage and death. Bring out your dead!”

Orchestral French Funk with Kit Sebastian,"All music rights belong to their rightful owners. Please support the musicians and buy their music.
#vinylmix #french #60s

Kit Sebastian is a duo formed in London by Kit Martin and Merve Erdem, spread between Turkey and France. Their music is a meeting point of different genres from Anatolian Psychedelia and Brazilian Tropicalia to 60’s European pop and American jazz. Following their debut album 'Mantra Moderne' and two 7"" releases, they released their second album 'Melodi' this autumn that's considered as a joyous merging of soundscapes, evoking a borderless planet with music as an international language. The duo also produces and directs their own music videos.

These tracks cover the period between the mid-60s to mid-70s in France when arrangers were exploring sophisticated and abstract arrangements within pop music.

The magic of the Ancient North.
Music, skillfully balancing on the brink of ritual ambient and the traditional folk of Northern Europe, is born in the heart of Siberia. The instruments created by the musicians of the band awaken something sacred, long forgotten. And the beats of the drums, amplified by throat singing, lead the Siberian shamans' path far through the vast taiga.

""Emerging from the frostbitten, dark and brooding woods of Siberia, NYTT LAND ascends as one of the most captivating and haunting musical forces in folk music. On their new album, Ritual, out August 6 via Napalm Records, NYTT LAND effortlessly pulls listeners into a world of ancient percussive instrumentation and vocal tradition: eight songs on Ritual tell tales of gods and heroes, born centuries ago and preserved in traditions, expressed in a unique sonic experience that can best be described by the duo iself as Shamanic Dark Folk.

NYTT LAND’s ancient shamanic culture is palpable on songs like “U-Gra” – based on the legend of the Siberian native tribe known as Khanty. It tells the story of the guardian spirits of the tribe’s homeland as somber ritual chants at the start of the song ask the spirits to be kind to their people and help them retain their lands. An atmospheric, meditative journey accompanied by an enthralling percussive section accents the unmatched, unique throat singing vocal layers of NYTT LAND. “Svartravn” seamlessly continues this vibe while introducing melancholic string sections, telling the story of a warrior dying on the battlefield with a crow circling him, awaiting his coup de grace. The dying warrior tells the crow about his worthy life and the deeds that he performed, and that he is not afraid of death, asking the raven to take the news of his death to his family. Underlying themes on Ritual become apparent in NYTT LAND’s artistic entity, pulled together by mysterious, haunting visuals while still welcoming the listener into their spiritual world. Songs like “Dead Man’s Dance” and “Blood Of The North” showcase the Nordic folk-driven roots of NYTT LAND, while the shamanic duo takes the genre to new levels on “The Fires of Ragnarok” and title track “Ritual”. Ritual is a previously uncharted display of intense, dark folk music inspired by NYTT LAND’s unique, authentic and ancient Siberian culture. If bands like WARDRUNA, HEILUNG or RUNAHILD ensnare your senses, then you must prepare for this Ritual!""

☩ ☩ ☩

Vengeance from the Grave

Nobody at the village
Ever understood my misery
Disgust and repulsion
Is what I received from Bernan
Nobody at the village
Is aware of the secret I keep
Now on through the ages
Who'll laugh at Murdo anymore

Hidden by bare trees a castle has been standing
Where they carried out unholy rites for their evil will
Sacrificing and tormenting mercilessly
Under their aegis the village was held

People rose against them
Iron and fire over the Templars fortress
Burn both of their eyes
They will not find the path to come back as they swine

As sworn tonight they will come back
I'll be their eyes to lead them where
They'll soothe their blood thirst from your sons
Will you repent before you're dead!

Let them have their vengeance from the grave, no
Useless to hide, they'll hear you. No way to
Escape death, they will banquet with your hearts
You will die pierced by their unholy swords

Tonight at the village
They will come back from the grave
Trough fires and laughter
I'm not alone, I'm with them
To reach for the village
All that they need is my lead
It will be a beautiful feast

☩ ☩ ☩

Blood of the Dead

In a boundless and spectral field
Some old ruins are telling me
About furious deeds of invaders
It smells of cruelty and genocide.
He trudges hardly out of the light
Broken bones harrow the flesh.
He seems to hear and advice in their wind
And then he drinks the Blood of the Dead

Hold on, despite the dark in your mind
Hold on, the sickle won't wait your time
Hold on, despite the black in your eyes
Hold on

A baleful swarming impious desecration
An evil seeding takes him a new life
His eyes are haunted with ruby damnation
One draught and you can't refrain from the blood
He trudges hardly towards the darkness
Blinding, wrathful, that thirst never ceases
Lust for flesh, he can feel the death living
He sinks in league with dark forces

Now I clearly see which side I stand

But when the beast wakes up, the hunger must be
satisfied
And when the darkness descends you'll pray and beg
for your pain and your grief
But after all you'll hear the call of the one who redraft
all his creatures

Abate your rage, eternity is long
The human race will feed you with blood
Don't be afraid about what will be
Believe in me...

Satan's Wizards, what a name!!!
It could be the title of a horror movie from the 70s. Much like the intro of this eponymous track is freely based on the Tombs of the Blind Dead's soundtrack.
How can we discribe our Doom? It's like a vertigo in the pit!

lyrics
SATAN’ S WIZARDS

We are legion in the whole world
We do the job for Satan to clean up this earth of lies
Perpetrate by the wickeds of mankind.

I promise to everyone, that anything will be not like before our coming.

Then, prepare to change.
We are the future, the fate, the split like a vertigo in the pit

Heavy clouds darken the sky
Hurry up! Make a choice
Don’ t stay still and move, join us and increase the rows.

Listen my word, come and see.
Sharpen your sword and follow me.
You understand, you have the faculty to liberate yourself and to feed your fury.

Be strong in your mind and you try to survive.
In the end of the fight, your spirit shall be rise.

Let be a satan’s wizard
You can see the light.

""Italy gave birth to the genres of Horror Movies and Horror Metal. If BLACK SABBATH and GOBLIN gave birth to a band, this band would be it. This is a very raw/flawed recording, very atmospheric with its 70's style synthesizer, haunting vocals (sung in English, but with a heavy Italian accent), and hypnotic riffs. It's off beat in nature, but if you want dark, as darker than the word black, this recording is not to be missed. ""Land Of Mystery"" was ahead of its time and the holy grail of the Italian Doom Metal scene. This is the cream of the crop and if you're into Heavy Metal and Doom Metal, it would be sacrilegious to not own this album.""

Eyes Like Snow Records/Finnish Doom Metal
From The Meadows Of Opium Dreams full-length: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJioxRX5STo

I. The Burning Desert

As I walk alone in the land of sand and heat
Listening to the winds singing hexes in my ears
The moon reveals the paths marked by an unknown race
Wanderers from behind the stars who came here before men

I can hear the desert cry, it's dark when the moon does hide
And I am trapped behind the wall of time

As the sunrise kills the night their temples fill the sky
As another day goes by I know this is where I'll die
In my dreams a black-clad witch guides me on my way
But every time I reach for her she says that she cannot stay

I can hear the call of gods, they want me by their side
But are their temples just within my mind?

II. The Witch

Oh, don't leave me
Empress of the night
I won't deceive thee
And I long to reach your shrines up in the sky

Temples in the sky
Light shines in her eyes
Chaos of her mind crawling deep inside

Face down to the ground... don't you make a sound
Hear their awful cry
This is where you die...

III. The Meadows of Opium Dreams

In dreams I went to find her at the meadows of opium dreams
Where nameless things go play their games
under the purple moon
I walked across the desert, she walked ahead of me
Stopped and looked into my eyes
I saw my destiny

No, I cannot reach their temples
and if you find me...

She laid there right beside me and took me deep within
Moonbeams dancing on her skin
As pale as a dead can be
Her eyes were full of hatred as she whispered in my ear...
""In the temples in the sky they wait
and they want both you and me!""

No I cannot reach their temples
and if you find me

Just walk your way

The Vapors - Turning Japanese,"Here is Lyrics :

I've got your picture of me and you
You wrote ""I love you"" I wrote ""me too""
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh it's in color
Your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel
And soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around

I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of you all 'round myself
I want a doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well
You've got me turning up and turning down
I'm turning in I'm turning 'round

I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of them all 'round myself
I want a doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well
You've got me turning up I'm turning down
I'm turning in I'm turning 'round

I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women
No fun, no sin, no you, no wonder it's dark
Everyone around me is a total stranger
Everyone avoids me like a cyclone Ranger
Everyone...

That's why I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

Forbidden Place Records announces March 3rd release date for The Eye of the Icosahedron, the new double album by Dungeon Weed!

DUNGEON WEED’s first album, Mind Palace of the Mushroom God, was conjured in the early days of pandemic lockdown as a collaboration between multi-instrumentalist Dmitri Mavra (Skunk, Slow Phase) and Chris McGrew, studio engineer/session drummer at San Francisco’s Wally’s Hyde Out, along with singer Thia Moonbrook. A concept album in which a sorcerer bargains for immortality with Orcus, God of the Underworld, and makes a deal that goes horribly wrong, Mind Palace of the Mushroom God was an instant hit with its eye-blasting artwork and heavy “wizard sludge” riffs. The band was signed to Forbidden Place Records within days and the first vinyl pressing sold out soon after.

Now, the story comes to an epic conclusion in the new double album as the sorcerer seeks the mystical gem that will free him from the curse of Orcus.
McGrew, Moonbrook, and Mavra are joined by synth lord Rama to weave this eldritch tale of dark, mind-bending magic. Hypnotic riffs flow seamlessly into dreamlike interludes, transporting the listener through the many shifting moods of this psychedelic doom epic. Dungeon Weed’s “wizard sludge” is unique a heavy doom sound that touches on stoner rock, black metal, dungeon synth, prog, and more.

One of the most iconic themes from one of my absolute favorite games of all time, I've put off recording this song for years! So glad to finally dig into this song, and the challenges that came with it. Without much percussion, I noticed this arrangement didn't hit as hard as the original, so I got creative and put my own percussion in. The goal was the make it sound just like the original and not get in the way. It's crazy how many of my favorite songs Koji Kondo composed... Hope you guys enjoy :)

Stone Axe - Stay of Execution (Full Album 2022),"Port Orchard's soulful 70s rockers STONE AXE make a triumphant return with their first release in over a decade. ""Stay of Execution"" is a collection of unreleased tracks and hidden gems, about which Stone Axe founder and multi-instrumentalist Tony Reed says: “Stay of Execution is an album of unreleased recordings and tracks we like that were hidden in the grooves of vinyl that was released in very limited numbers with little or no promotion. All songs were recorded between 2008 and 2011 and cover a wide spectrum of styles in that seventies vein we were known for. The musical concepts of proto-metal, southern rock, psychedelic rock, and folk rock are well-explored in this collection. Seven of the eight tracks on the album feature the usual studio collaboration of Reed / Brinkerhoff, while the last song includes all four members of the live band. I feel like these tracks are as strong as anything on our other long players. It’s great to see them finally get released.”=

Doomed & Stoned: The Instrumentalists (Vol. III) | Full Album Compilation 2021,"Buy Digital Album / name your price: https://doomedandstoned.bandcamp.com/album/doomed-stoned-the-instrumentalists-vol-iii
INTRODUCTION:''For the past several years, we've been noticing a significant upswing in the number of instrumental bands making their presence known on Bandcamp and elsewhere. That is, rock and metal collaborations that have opted to do without a singer. At first, I admit greeting such projects with a squint eye, but my skepticism quickly dissipated once I heard what they were capable of doing musically and artistically.

Thus far in our four-volume series, we've borne witness to a bountiful array of heavy music-making talent who have turned the medium into practically its own form of art.

Before us lay an eclectic collection of bands, several of whom have been significant game-changers in the sub-genre like Clouds Taste Satanic with their ""character pieces"" (in this case taking a page out of The Book of Revelation and animating it stunningly to life). The Brooklyn band's prowess for creating visual tone poems is nothing short of stunning. They are at the forefront of creativity and innovation in this burgeoning genre.

Another example is one-man band Hellvetika, brainchild of incredible musical mind Aaron D.C. Edge (who has been involved in too many bands to count). Here he doesn't simply cover Kyuss, he transforms it into a sludgey beast that gives you a good idea of what's in store for you when you dive into his voluminous catalogue.

Still others, such as ""endless jam band"" Böse from Poland, completely improvise every single composition they commit to record, applying something of a jazz ethos towards psychedelic doom. To say they are prolific is an understatement once you see the discography they've amassed in only a couple of years.

Once again, huge gratitude is due to Rob Hammer for helping me to organize this rather intimidating project (and to his mum for the stellar album art!), which has had us racking our brains and scouring the globe to find bands we think you'll not only enjoy, but appreciate.

With that said, it has been my joy to personally curate the arrangement before you in Doomed & Stoned: The Instrumentalists (Vol. III).

Give ear...''

New Heavy Sounds is very proud to bring you Moongazer, the second album by the four-piece heavy stoner rock powerhouse from Italy, TENEBRA.
Moongazer contains nine slabs of crushing fuzzed up grooves, fuelled by 70’s proto metal, hard rock and psych-blues, loaded with great riffs and melody and topped off by gutsy soulful vocals.
Musically, you could say that TENEBRA occupy similar musical terrain to bands such as Graveyard, Witchcraft, Kadaver and other bands of that ilk, but TENEBRA are very much their own beast. They have all the chops of course, but are musically less slavish, often adding a twist that keeps the songs fresh and now. There’s also very little reliance on Sabbath-isms (apart from one cheeky nod) and though occult rock is also part of the vibe, the music steers well clear of the cliches. In fact the band bring a clutch of left field influences into their melting pot as well, from June of 44 and Love Battery to the Misfits and the psych grunge of Screaming Trees, much of it in evidence on this new album. In fact Gary Lee Conner of Screaming Trees actually contributes to 'Moon Maiden'.
Of the four members, Claudio (bass), Emilio (guitar) and Mesca (drums) came from the hardcore and post-hardcore squat scene that gathered around Bologna, whereas their formidable vocalist Silvia (the youngest of the crew) is immersed in the underground rock of the '60s and' 70s. When you hear her sing you’ll know where she’s coming from as she has one helluva rock voice, laced with whiskey, smoke, grit, late nights and a whole lotta soul. Think Maggie Bell meets Betty Davis with a smattering of Gillan, and you'll be in the right ballpark.
What you get with ‘Moongazer’ is a band revelling in the spirit of 70’s rock rather than recreating it, and it's a thrilling ride.

Zen Gangster Ballad Breaks & Beats: Lofi Hip Hop Compilation Vol. 1,"Flipping beautiful but forgotten melodies from the past and fusing them with hard, heavy-hitting b-boy breaks of fury.

Volume 1 marks a shift - from coping to crafting. The pain is still there, but now it’s sharpened, channeled, and intentional.

This is where the Zen Gangster Ballad takes form: emotionally charged loops, hardwired drums, and a commitment to finding stillness through sound.

These tracks weren’t made to impress - they were made to express. To process. To stay human.

Toro y Moi - Causers of This (Instrumentals),"Buy/Listen: https://found.ee/TYM-Causers-10year

""'Causers of This' is a glimpse into my early life as a suburban, American, POC. It is a reaction to what it feels like to lose. Ironically, all of the sessions and files making up the album were lost in a car burglary in 2009; all that was left were the instrumentals. The lyrics were the last element added on this particular record and I'm excited for my listeners to experience the album the way I first intended it to be. Now, 10 years later, it feels more appropriate than ever to release this pared-down version of the record to leave space for thought and reflection. Thank you all for being a part of this journey with me.

50% of the Bandcamp proceeds from the Causers instrumentals today (6/27) will go to People's Breakfast Oakland.

Toro y Moi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 29, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- Chaz Bear, who performs as Toro y Moi, is going to do what he feels. In preparation for his Tiny Desk concert, we were given two possible sound scenarios: aim to recreate the heavily electronic and lustrous aura that birthed his latest LP, Outer Peace or strip away the bells and whistles for an acoustic performance. The game-time decision was the latter and fans were treated to brand new iterations of these songs.

Toro y Moi's discography conveys that same unpredictability and showcases his affinity for a wide span of genres. While largely known as an early pioneer of chillwave, Outer Peace is anything but. It's hard-hitting, funky and directly to the point, as is this Tiny Desk concert. Stripping down such heavily produced songs could risk revealing weaknesses. In this case, the rhythms move just the same. Removing the Auto-Tune, synths and effects make way for some insightful songwriting that's often hard to hear in the recorded version.

""Life is only wishing we could load it
Level up, you've got to make a bonus
Mystic staring at his phone for oneness
Silver or black mirror, what's the difference?""

With shaker in tow, Bear sat front and center at a stool to deliver four of my favorites from Outer Peace, including ""Ordinary Pleasure,"" with bongo assistance from Foots of Foot and Coles.

CHILDREN OF DOOM

Children of doom
We are your father
And we are like no other
Let me see your hands
Let me hear you scream
Because you are here
And you know what it means...
We are the children of doom
Give us some room

Like an ancient idol
We stand before you
But we are nothing
Nothing more than you
You are the ones
Who keep us alive
We can feel it from you
See it in your eyes
We are the children of doom
Give us some room

We are the secret
Soon to be known
The more we're together
The quicker we grow
We are the end
Of the endless maze
We are the light
In the daily haze
We are the children of doom

PLANET OF JUDGEMENT

Stranded here a thousand light years away from home
Blackened clouds fill their horizons
Storms to come
They cut down their forests with steel jagged blades
And poison their air
Scorning the surface with nuclear waste
Nature cries

We saw them fight their wars again
They never won
So unwise, no surprise
Their own demise
Pain and starvation throughout their nations
Injustice prevails
Falling from grace, destined to die
We wonder why...

""Heed the warning, time is dawning
Come ye faithful, meet thy maker... it's (His) time""

Stood there helpless
Saw their sun set
So relentless
The very last time

What made them wander this trail of sorrow that has to end?
The signs around them, plain and simple
They chose to pretend
Now nothingness is all that remains
A pity and shame
Should have learned to follow the rules
If you decide to play the game

PLAGUE OF MAN

Come and listen to my tale of woe
My final downfall came not long ago
I have got a disease that breeds tears
It's been plaguing man for years and years

Everybody here knows how it feels
When the heartache grows beyond unreal
All you do is think about that girl
Then the madness cracks your eggshell world

Everything around you falls apart
We have lost the race right from the start
Nothing left inside a washed-out brain
Weighted down forever by her chains
It's the plague of man

FEAR

In the dark recesses
of your little mind
I begin to breathe
It's getting near my time
As the bloody rivers
flow through your veins
I am growing stronger
You'll never be the same

If you think I'm nothing
You better think again
Once you get me started
You will never win
You'll feel me inside you
When you're all alone
Common sense will leave
Then you're mine to own

Feel me
I'm part of you
Feel me
I know you do

Now you're sweating ice
You shake everyday
And it gives me pleasure
To watch your world decay
As you split your seams
And your nerves are shot
You cannot face the world
All control is lost

BELA

Do you know me
I think you do
I rise each night
From my tomb
My bone-dry lips
Long for you
I feed on humans
Freshly brewed

My mortuary
Is a gruesome sight
As I play with you
In the dead of night
I'm never caught
And I'm never seen
As I crease the sky
With the blackest wings

The crack of dawn
Sends a chill through me
I know that I must end my feast
Into the dust I must go
Until the next moonbeam glows

HALLOW'S VICTIM

Panic in the air
Awaken to the call
Ghostly apparitions
Making your skin crawl
Incense, tambourines
Sorcerers arise
All you see are pools of blood
And fire in their eyes

Grinning jack-o-lanterns
Lit by candle-light
Cauldrons bubble over-filled
On this night of nights
Leather bat-like wings
Slicing through the air
Leaves your body white with shock
You're wide-eyed and scared

Cross in your hand
Time to take your stand
Your bravery's fading somehow
Garlic 'round your neck
Paranoia's got you wrecked
You jump at every little sound

Boney witches fingers
Are scratching at your face
Skeletons sit beside you
Making your heart race
Cold sweat is running
Running from your brow
You've got a one-way ticket
To six feet underground

Cross in your hand
Time to take your stand
Your bravery's fading somehow
Garlic 'round your neck
Paranoia's got you wrecked
You jump at every little sound

Da Captain Trips - Maths of the Elements (2022) (Full Album),"Da Captain Trips - Maths of the Elements (Full Album) Da Captain Trips is an instrumental psychedelic stoner rock band based in the north of Italy. Maths of the Elements is the fourth full length of the band and comes five years after “Adventures in the Upside Down”. This album is dedicated to Nature, its Elements, and the slow growth of everything. Each track wants to drive the listener to immerse themselves in a slow journey of awareness of the elements of nature. The songs breathe and develop slowly, are more dilated and improvised than “Adventures in the upside-down”. 

Each Captain album is different from the previous one also thanks to the line-up changes that this time sees Bachis give way to Paolo “Apollo” Negri on keyboards. This allows the band to reach still unexplored territories, abandoning in some cases the song form. Between songs, field recordings by the friend Hi-Fi Panorama were added to help the process and Kabuto also gives his interpretation with the artwork. The central figure represents the shaman/scientist who tries to interpret and analyze the surrounding nature. But, being part of nature itself, it cries because understanding is both touching and disturbing. The design is completed by the four symbols of the elements, air, water, fire, and earth.

Da Captain Trips - Adventures in the Upside Down (2018) (Full Album),"Da Captain Trips - Adventures in the Upside Down (Full Album) Da Captain Trips have always been a band not constrained by one single approach to music making, they incorporate many different styles, genres etc in their output making them always interesting and always worth checking out. 'Adventures In The Upside Down'  is no different - taking in psychedelia, Space Rock, Prog, krautrock and even surf and, all in all, a damn fine listen! 

'The Calm And The Storm' opens the album with a long, drawn out drone and some electronic effects before a lonesome guitar is heard over the drone - it's all very melancholic and sounding distinctly nautical, with a 'twanging' downbeat surfy vibe. The track opens up to become a motoring psych/space rock number with flashes of kosmische electronica under the guitar. 'Manta' has an intro that reminded me of the 'Knightrider' theme - random I know!. However, it immediately transforms into another chuggin' track with more than a hint of krautrock about it...so far, so great. 'Revelation' is something different altogether....the twang heard in the first track returns with vengeance...a trippy, surf vibe is built, like Jan and Dean on acid, broken only by passages of more cosmic electronica and jazzy psych with saxophone courtesy of Lee Relfe from Sendelica. It's a great track that leaves the listener wondering where things are going next.

'Dear Zahdia' has a very retro feel about it, the vibe is very seventies with flashes of prog, mainly due to the organ sounding synth work. As the track travels it's course things become heavier and far more psych. 'Trespasses Bay - Peaceful Place' is the longest and most complex of the tracks. It has again that wonderful twang guitar giving it a surf feel and, like the previous track, it does have a proggy feel at times but in the main it is a slowburning, psychedelic meander, chocked full of atmosphere and plenty of reverb. The last section has some great electronica that once again takes us back to the seventies.

The album is brought to a close by 'Mother Earth'...starting with some bucolic guitar that is bordering on folk, it is an initially pastoral track that shows another side to the band - a side that is not afraid to eschew their psychedelic musings for something more introspective and contemplative... for a while at least..it blossoms into a superlative jam as it nears the end of it's ten minute length. 'Adventures In The Upside Down' is a great album, full of invention and wonder - taking different aspects of the 'psych' world and mixing them to form an album that is actually remarkably restful and evocative. It is still as trippy as hell in places but, maybe more than their other recordings, more reliant on technique and craft rather than all out jamfests. It is, in short, a 'grown up' album.

During these crazy times, we cannot spend time and interact with each other anymore. But this should not and will not stop us exploring and sharing the good music. Jannis from Habibi Funk played some awesome gems for us from his Berlin flat. I personally, -as a collector and music lover, am a huuuge fan of his label. I own almost all of the releases that they put out. Last week when he asked if he can make a guest mix for the channel, I was thrilled! In this mix, you will hear some legends like Ziad Rahbani and Ahmed Fakroun. And he's playing both tapes and records. Honestly, I enjoyed every second of it. I hope you will too.

THE RE-STONED – is an instrumental power trio from Moscow, Russia, which is generally considered by many as a 'psychedelic stoner rock' underground act because of the band's remarkable heavily fuzzed guitar sound, that is empowered by confident old-school muscular riffing.

After almost 6 years passed we start feeling the same vibrations like saying ‘isn’t it the right time to do such kind of jam again to see how much progress we made since then?’ In February 2020 Evgeniy Tkachev finally made it to Moscow from distant Siberia with his good old djembe drum and we were lucky enough to record a lot of new material in 4 days. By the way it’s worth mentioning that the song “Rusty Shuffle” was initially recorded for the album ‘Stories of the Astral Lizard vol.2’ but later was re-recorded with the full drum set and made it to the “Thunders of the Deep” album. All guitar parts, mandolin, effects and even some bass parts I recorded myself, more complicated bass parts were recorded by our incredible bassist Vladimir Kislyakov. The unique flute and clarinet player Maxim Dobromyslov participated as a guest as well. I’m curious what would you say discovering a clarinet sound in The Re-Stoned? Anyway it was a great feeling of magic in the studio. Of course, our new album transmits different feelings and vibrations comparing to the Part 1.

In J.R.R.Tolkien’s ‘The Lord of the Rings’ Gandalf says ‘A wizard is never late, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.’ So, rephrasing the classic quote I can say that ‘The Lizard is never late, nor is it early. It arrives precisely when it means to.’ Which is the particular case with our new album. We promise to take you to another journey through the stories of the Astral Lizard, but are you ready to travel?

Electric Mountain - Valley Giant (Full Album 2022),"Order:https://www.electricvalleyrecords.com/category/electric-valley-records-releases (Vinyl)
https://evrecords.bandcamp.com/album/electric-mountain-valley-giant (Vinyl + Digital)
Emerged from Mexico City in 2013, Electric Mountain teems with the ‘70s haze and the ‘90s desert/stoner hardness. The power trio exults in fuzzy guitars, thunderous drums, and thick dirty bass lines, and seemingly, these aspects thunderingly dominated their 2017’s s/t debut album (originally released on CD by LSDR and later released on LP by Electric Valley Records). Notorious for being a very loud and energetic live act, the power trio has shared the stage with Elder and Blackwater Holylight, amongst several other bands. 
After a short hiatus, Electric Mountain returns with their second full-length, Valley Giant, with a more mature and intricate sound. On the new album, the Mexican heavy rocking crew sings new stories throughout nine burly structured songs surrounded by doomy and bluesy atmospheres. Despite staying a thousand miles high, Electric Mountain is determined to take over every stage they set foot on.

Elektric Mistress - Chapter 99 (EP 2022),"Halifax, Nova Scotia’s Elektric Mistress has a new EP “Chapter 99” coming out, which promises to be a sonic blast of psychedelic groove tinged with occult overtones and sludgy riffs. This will be their second EP, following their self-titled in 2019. Since then, they have added a new guitarist and a potent new layer of sounds for fans to discover. The first single they are releasing is the title track, a stomper that will get you moving and vibing to the lyrical themes of communing with the dead. The band explains further: 

“Chapter 99 was honestly not the first choice for this single; we had some trouble deciding just what to present, because we think they’re all pretty ok, heh. We decided to get an objective set of ears to sort out our predicament, and this one stood out above the rest. It’s about trying to connect with the other side. It has a definite occult overtone, in the oldest heavy music tradition.” 

Having a second guitarist has added to the complexity of the band, although their evolution has remained fairly steady over the past couple of years. They have started to incorporate guitar harmonies to complement their stoner rock style but still leave room to be unique and creative and resonate with listeners. Lyrics are inspired by events, people, memories, feelings, or certain energy. There are plenty of psychedelics, sci-fi, witchcraft, and apes! 

The EP “Chapter 99” was entirely recorded and self-produced by the band, and all the stringed instruments and keys are digital. It was mixed and mastered by Alex Burris at Fang Recordings, and the EP artwork was done by Ricardo Arreola. 

Elektric Mistress is not out to reinvent the wheel, they deliver straightforward rock n’ roll vibes for good times and bad. They are recommended listening for fans of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Pink Floyd.

1. Magic Dust:
Pure stoner rock. Also, a tasty organ solo in the middle. It's about two people embarking on a romantic psychedelic trip together for the first time.  
2. Radio:
A song about how music or a song brings back memories of past relationships. Our most Black Sabbath-type riff, for sure. Riley came up with the main riff on this one.
3. Cocaine Johnny:
It's a fun and high energy song with some dark lyrics about addiction. Cocaine's a hell of a drug!  Purple worship, pure and simple. Just tuned a lot lower. This one was written by Maxwell pretty much entirely.
4. Chapter 99:
It's a great time! It's a party and everyone’s invited, even the dead!  People have been trying to connect the dead since the beginning of time, via seances, spells, and Oujia boards. A stomper for sure. Hopefully, it gets people moving.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iOtxknsTk1M/sddefault.jpg,666MrDoom,3097,150,13,1197,19:57,"19 Minutes, 57 Seconds",2022-06-17T08:00:07,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOtxknsTk1M

"𝙲𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚛𝚞𝚖 ""𝙵ö𝚛 𝙼𝚎𝚍𝚒𝚝𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗""","Centrum ""För Meditation"" 
Stoner Psychedelic spiritual drone 
Black vinyl

“The mantra that you’re given in Transcendental Meditation you keep to yourself. The reason being, true happiness is not out there, true happiness lies within” - so states David Lynch, a vocal proponent of this art on a twice-daily basis since 1973. It’s a maxim that holds true to Sweden’s Centrum, whose Rocket Recordings debut forms no less than a mysterious yet meaningful voyage into inner space.

Indeed, on ‘För Meditation’ these sometime members of Hills and Weary Nous explore a soundworld that demonstrates all too adeptly that true heaviness of intent need not be the preserve of demonic riffs and highly cranked amps. Weaving a dense and beguiling tapestry of drone-based hypnosis, mantric vocal chants and ritualistic folk along with field recordings from a trip the members made to India, this band also inadvertently plots our a map from the experimental music of the early-‘70s to the present, alighting on a myriad touchstones on the way.

Yet tempting through it may be to place ‘För Meditation’ amidst the uniquely Swedish lineage of primal and arcadian Psychedelia that began with artists like Arbete Och Fritid, Träd, Gras och Stenar and International Harvester, the band are keen to emphasise that inspiration arrives at Centrum from all quarters. “From Pandit Pran Nath to Trees, from Velvet Underground to Popol Vuh, anything and everything.

So lay down relax, turn off your phone and let Centrum
be your guide!

Who are this mysterious cult phenomenon known as Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats? We are not able to shed much light on the identity of this drug-crazed coven of freaks but their addictive blend of heavy, melodic and garage horror-rock sounds have already taken the underground by storm.  The popularity of this anonymous bunch initially stemmed from people discovering tracks uploaded by them to Youtube, without any other hype. Two extremely limited self-financed mail order only Cd-r only albums were released (Vol 1 & Blood Lust) and interest in the band grew rapidly.

A vinyl edition of Blood Lust was released by Rise Above Records in 2011, which sold out instantly. Demand for this vinyl edition set the record collecting market on fire, with first pressing copies fetching up to £700 on eBay. It was re-pressed on vinyl a second time earlier in 2012 and again sold out in minutes with the Rise Above Records website crashing under the strain of a staggering amount of hits.

All of this has happened without any live performances or clear photographs of the band ever being published. Whilst the electrifying quality of their music is unquestionable, their true identity still remains a mystery. All of this is about to change when they are finally unveiled for their hugely anticipated debut live performance in London, UK on March 22nd and 23rd. A second date has had to be added due to the high demand and the first night selling out in a very short space of time.

Having recently signed to Rise Above Records, they are due to enter the studio on Halloween 2012 to record their first full-length album for the label, which is due for a March 2013 release. In the meantime we are delighted to be giving the already legendary Blood Lust it’s first officially licensed release.
Blood Lust is music brings back the dark spirit of true rock and roll as conjured up by this anonymous cult of horror worshipping fiends. Uncle Acid has come to kill!

From Nathan Davis take on ”Çeçen kızı” to Ahmed Malek’s cinematic soundscapes on ”Autopsie D'un Complot”, ”Neveen” by Salah Ragab’s incredible Cairo Jazz Band and music by Nicolas Dick, Hamlet Minassian, Taroub, Selda and a much more.

A Deeper Kind of Slumber is the fifth studio album from Swedish band Tiamat. Featuring female background vocals by Birgit Zacher (Moonspell, Angel Dust) and experimentation with a variety of influences, the album marked the group's first complete withdrawal from both death metal and conventional heavy metal, following their 1994 release, Wildhoney. It was also the first production after their relocation to Germany, and was written almost entirely by founder/lead songwriter Johan Edlund. Much of the music had reflected on Edlund's personal relationship with drugs, creative differences within the band as well as an interpersonal relationship.

PETH - Merchant of Death (Full Abum 2022),"Central Texas is well known for its underground heavy rock ‘n’ roll from the late ‘60s,’70s, and ‘80s: — a series of sounds different than any other place on earth have been originated and evolved from here time and time again. Fast forward some 50 years later and there are still the same hell-raisin, beer-drinking, guitar-slinging rock ‘n’ cowboys makin some noise in the Lone Star! Hence, it’s no surprise that in the 21st century, a band like PETH come along and start making some big ‘70s Texas noise! 

Born in the middle of the 2020 pandemic, these four native Texans have been doin all the maniacal and lawless exploits with a wild mix of early ‘70s proto-metal and heavy psych/occult rock soundscapes matched to that of early Black Sabbath, Scorpions, Medusa, Venom, Blue Cheer, Pentagram, ZZ Top, and the likes. Conjuring evil guitarmonies (what they call guitar harmonies), explosive trucking bass and drum section, and two knock-out vocalists, PETH truly help preserve the spirit of Texas’s old way of life while helping usher in this new era of rock ‘n’ roll for generations to follow.

PETH’s debut LP, Merchant of Death, is a hidden gem of the ‘70s/’80s metal invasion, but got discovered in the 21st century. The album in part brings menacing aggressions, in part brings breathtaking rhythms, but steers clear of the modern, lustrous sonic aesthetics. Roll out the red carpet for Merchant of Death and revel in the wilderness.

Lyrics: 
J’ai quitté mon pays et ma Louisiane
Mais dans d’autres pays, adieu Savanne
J’ai trouvé le métro n’est pas un petit boulot Mais je suis, je suis un nègre
J’ai quitté un ami et ma Louisiane
Mais dans d’autres pays, adieu Savanne.

C’est comme un jour un sage à dit: 
Au lieu de nous donner des bombes, 
Donnez-nous des motos-pompes pour trouver la vie heureuse et avoir une vie de sagesse
Un grand hommage à feu Ali Farka Touré, merci

Into The Sun

Journey a thousand years deep in my mind
Transcending space to the dawn of all time
Dark shining backs break across desert sands
Nephilim’s children of Eve marching
Into the sun

Pyramids reaching up into the sky
God Marduk Ra lies in wait for the sign
Shadows move over, tell coming of one
On knees awaiting, our eyes turned up
Into the sun

Father of Adam shall come for his claim
Bringer of life and the giver of pain
Soon is upon us the day we are one
Children of false gods shall drive them back
Into the sun

Eastern Woman

Well she made me sit down with the doctor
To try to make sense of my mind
She never knew all the sense that the doctor would find
And I cried as I finally left her
And married a Dutch woman’s child
Tried as I might couldn’t live with the ways of the wild

Got myself an Eastern woman
Fires burning deep inside
Got myself an Eastern woman’s eye

So I read the Armenian’s letter
Said she came close to the end
I headed south never knowing what was to begin
And I know that I never can leave her
She found her way to my soul
Handed my heart to that girl of the night at the door

Son of Misery

Dark ships move onto the shore
Through the devil’s doorway
Pale men set upon this land
No mercy in their veins
Poison seeps unto the earth
Like some rain of hate

Call him man of God
Call him the son of misery
Call him lies and murder
Call him the son of misery

No One makes a Sound

Eagles of destruction they are rising
Father can you hear your sons are dying
Screaming faces make no sound
Safely seen from off the ground
Fires in the crescent moon keep burning

And they ain’t gonna listen
Until no one makes a sound

Iron tigers rolling through the darkness
Crushing hopes and dreams under their cold, relentless wheels
Screaming faces make no sound
Safely seen from off the ground
Fires in the crescent moon keep burning

And they ain’t gonna listen
Until no one makes a sound

TV eye is always watching
Tells us what to feel
Another world their little lives seem anything but real
TV man says it’s ok, don’t worry ‘bout a thing
TV eye is always watching
You don’t have to think

And they ain’t gonna listen
Until no one makes a sound

☩ ☩ ☩

Capricorn

It’s the nature of existence, the circling of time
A man within his castle sings the songs within his mind
A thousand winking magic stars
A thousand tales to tell
Commanding them with quickness
Sits the wizard in his shell

You move these feelings from the mind into the soul
You guide the madness from the blind
Oh Capricorn

The meeting of the madness
Machines reflecting love
Spiraling in colors down from something held above
The memories of children lost
Their kings they froze in stone
These fools of re-connection try
To sit upon their throne

You move these feelings from the heart into the soul
You guide the madness from the blind
Oh Capricorn 

☩ ☩ ☩

Black Funeral

Sitting on borrowed time, yes it’s true
Man in the highest chair says you’re through
Clock on the wall ticks screaming in your mind
Devils stand waiting, laughing, you’ve arrived

Slipping into the grey, stealing your breath away
Hourglass out of sand, feeling the cold dark hand
Black funeral

Feeling your body fading from your mind
Falling in darkness leaving your life behind
Now is the time you answer for your ways
Living eternal darkness for all days

Slipping into the grey, stealing your breath away
Hourglass out of sand, feeling the cold dark hand
Black funeral

As your last breath slips into the future
Is it true?
What they said about the prophecies pretending
That they knew
Your energy is slowly slipping
Hands are gripping round your eyes
Who knows where you’ll go when you are ending
Ending all your time
Black funeral

☩ ☩ ☩

Cosmonaut of Three

I fall through space and time
Motion I cannot slow
Astral projection through worlds that I have not known
Facing my true self at last I’m locked in my mind
Drowning in visions released in circular time

My eyes wide open, for the first time
The light is falling through the trees
The faces smile at me, colors surround
I am the cosmonaut of three

Three is the number who have chosen this night
To step through the doorway
Embracing portals of sight
We cannot know where this strange journey will end
Ingesting cybin our bodies slowly transcend

Twisting and turning
Night turns to day
Facing my true self once again
I am the jury
Judgment to hang
Riding the darkness to the end

My eyes wide open, for the first time
The light is falling through the trees
The faces smile at me, colors surround
I am the cosmonaut of three

☩ ☩ ☩

Electric Father

No one knows what lies within your brain
Son of greed, construct of worlds of insane
Wires vibrate heartless thoughts that tell you what to do
Watching every moment of the game

It seems those who pray to you are sightless
It seems those who worship you see nothing of your plan

Electric Father
Watching from the sky
Floating in the silence as our freedom slowly dies
Electric Father
Cold collecting eye
Will you still be watching when we’re through?
Watching when there’s nothing left to do

High above your sleepless shadow turns
Synthetic super nova’s fires burn
Secret lives of twisted men
Who tell you what to do
Child of paranoia slowly learns

It seems those who pray to you are sightless
It seems those who worship you see nothing of your plan

Electric Father
Watching from the sky
Floating in the silence as our freedom slowly dies
Electric Father
Cold collecting eye
Will you still be watching when we’re through?
Watching when there’s nothing left to do

You watch with super sonic sight
Your eyes see everywhere
There are no secrets in our lives
Cannot escape your stare
Collecting, detecting
No love within your heart
The bastard son of paranoia
The watcher in the dark

Father
Hears my words
Spinning and counting
Watch everything that I do

Father
Hears my words
Silently listening
Waiting to tell about you

⋘ ── ∗ ⋅◈⋅ ∗ ── ⋙

Presenting the full album mix of NUMA's ""Tranquillitas"" shamanic downtempo compilation, released in winter last year. 

""The winter solstice marks a very special and spiritually important time of the year. Nature itself is asking us all to become more silent... to slow down... to rest. Animals go into hibernation and we as humans enjoy the sheltered comfort of our homes with a hot tea and a warm blanket.Winter is a time of darkness. The winter solstice marks the time where the days get shorter and the nights become longer. So there will be less light outside which in turn invites us to seek and find more light within. This time allows us to go deep within and to reflect upon the past and also connect with dreams and visions for the year to come. It's a great time for meditation and prayer to let go and relax.

Tranquillitas was the goddess and personification of tranquillity, security and peace, and it can be translated into calmness, peacefulness and a state of security and ease.

To support you in this process of introspection and meditation we have invited old and new friends to share their unique approach on this idea. Weather you just want to sit and listen, meditate, do your yoga practice, need a soundtrack for your ceremony or are looking for some intimate and deep moments in your ecstatic dance sets this compilation will be at your service. Each track is soulfully composed and invites the listener to gently open the heart and to connect with the inner emotional landscapes to find guidance and wisdom within.""

ON THE MOUNTAIN

What do you see that lies ahead of you
Listen to the forest and you’ll hear the echoes call
Following the trail you are bound to feel tall
Do you understand where we'll all be going to

On the mountain we shall survive
On the mountain conquest we'll find

Travelling this land there are many paths to take
Feel it in your heart an there will be no mistake
Blazing a trail there is fire in your eyes
Looking to the distance you can see the eagle soar

On the mountain we shall survive
On the mountain conquest we'll find

Climbing ever higher there is magic in the air
The wind is blowing hard as it flows through your hair
The final resting place is straight ahead of you
You’re on the mountain and you’ve done all you could do

On the mountain we shall survive
On the mountain conquest we'll find

GENERATION VOID

Where have we gone yesterday
Where will we be tomorrow
What lies straight ahead of us
Just cut the cards and place your bet

Skyscrapers standing all so tall
In a short time they all will fall
Enter a brand new universe
Overwhelmed by the new technology

Feel the thunder, shake the ground
Buildings are crumbling, just take a good look around
See the fire, in the sky, that's when it’s over, now it's
Your time to die
Look to the oceans, see them rising
A wall of waves will keep washing the filth away

Take my hand my children, and walk with me
Your life has just begun, oh can't you see
He'll lead us on, living for another day
Searching for a purpose, in the generation void

Freedom Hawk - Take All You Can (Full Album 2022),"Digital or Physical copies available at https://ripplemusic.bandcamp.com/music
Physical copies available at https://ripplemusic.bigcartel.com/
The champions of the East Coast underground are back in top form with their sixth-full length this fall! Following the success of their 2018 Ripple Music debut, 'Beast Remains', FREEDOM HAWK have made the most of the pandemic by channeling all their creative energy into setting up their own recording and rehearsal space and writing this 9-track record. Armed with confidence, the foursome delivers their strongest and most heartfelt effort, brimming with the vibe and energy of a relaxed band in a comfortable setting pouring their hearts out in every beat and note.

About the new album, the band says: 
""The world was and is in the need of love and the lyrics on this album convey this thought in a dark way. “Take All You Can” really expands into newer territory of tasty bluesy melodies, driving 
harmonies, and killer song structures that have hooks for days… We feel like it is our best stuff to date and we can't wait for people to hear it worldwide!""

"Eritrean Jazz, Soul & Traditional Grooves with Nahom from Eritrean Anthology","All music rights belong to their rightful owners. Please support the musicians and buy their music.
#vinylmix #eritrea  

Eritrean Anthology started out as a side project during the early days of Covid, with the primary objective to raise awareness over social media about the existence of Eritrean 45s from 1970-75, often overlooked or unknown of their existence. The project gathered momentum over the last 2 years, whilst in parallel my pursuit to collect as many records as I could possibly find gradually started to bear fruit, and has since enabled me to showcase these forgotten treasures to a community of curious listeners as well as those that connect to it culturally.

""The first record on the list is Halhalta Fichrichi, a soul-jazz influenced record performed by the legendary Zerai Deres Band and fronted by their lead singer, Haile Ghebru. I have made it a habit of mine to start my Eritrean sets with this record, as a tribute to a deceased family member whom at one time this record belonged to. It is probably the only Eritrean 45 I own that hasn't been previously owned by more than one person.

The vinyl era in Eritrea was short lived, spanning merely over 5 years, producing no more than 75 singles with limited copies in distribution making these records a collectors item no doubt, but more worryingly an era in Eritrean music history that may be at risk of being forgotten if not documented or celebrated.

I finished the set with one of the handful of Eritrean music inspired LPs produced in the diaspora, by German krautrock band, Dambisa, who features Eritrean vocalist Jamal M. Jassin. The track you hear is Asmarena, a cover originally written and performed by Osman Abdulrahim, the same artist who features twice during this set.""

HOUSE OF DOOM

Darker than amber
Dark like your bones
Clearer than crystal
In the death of the sun
Built on the ruins
Of the black angel’s tomb
The house of madness
Awake, burning for you

Welcome to the house of doom
A church of evil, a labyrinth of rooms
We are the children of the moon
We keep the dark alive in the house of doom

Like a finger to the gods
The tower it stands
Exhibition of evil
Monumental and grand
Floor on floor of fear
Temptation, decay
I’m cold, sinister
I’m wicked and strange

Welcome to the house of doom
A church of evil, a labyrinth of rooms
We are the children of the moon
We keep the dark alive in the house of doom

Like a statement of the sick
A mansion of grief
If you walk into the house
You will never leave

Welcome to the house of doom
A church of evil, a labyrinth of rooms
We are the children of the moon
We keep the dark alive in the house of doom

Lotus Emperor - Syneidesis (Full Album 2022),"Syneidesis (2022)
7 years after their self-titled debut, and a minor classic among the international heavy-psych scene, Lotus Emperor are back with “Syneidesis”, their second and debut for Sound Effect Records! Led by Constantina Latzaki’s voice, Lotus Emperor have broaden their horizons, moving on to a mystical journey, an atmospheric mixture of fuzzed-out doom, shoegaze and post-punk, all part of a deeply ritualistic psychedelic concept! On “Syneidesis” Lotus Emperor go cinematic and turn the “difficult” sophomore album to their most compelling work so far.

We open our sails for a second time! With aid from ""Anemos"" (Wind,) Lotus Emperor’s vessel travels again through the mysteries of life, using our sounds as a medium to carve the ""Petra""(Stone) and, through our “#59”  wormhole accelerator, shape the new collective ""Syneidesis"" (Consciousness) in order to get things done from the beginning to the “Synteleia” (The End).

Leif Edling on the new album: 
“Sweet Evil Sun is about hope, striving, adoration and failure. It's about all the personal battles that you have, but also the never-ending decay of humanity.
The record took over a year to make and there's not a bad track on it! We had a fantastic time recording it and are really looking forward to the release. It's Doom, It's Metal! It is the essence of CANDLEMASS put into one album!”",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-TdWgpqd-vg/sddefault.jpg,WEEDIAN,71775,1900,179,3236,53:56,"53 Minutes, 56 Seconds",2022-11-18T07:00:00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TdWgpqd-vg

"L'Impératrice at the Grand Palais, Paris - Passengers - ARTE Concert","#TAKOTSUBO #LIMPERATRICE 

[AVAILABLE UNTIL 26/03/2026]

Passengers a toujours eu le chic pour dénicher des lieux incroyables. Pour ce nouveau numéro, la barre est mise encore très haut : c’est sous la nef du Grand Palais que nous recevons @limperatrice_. Charles de Boisseguin, Flore Benguigui et leurs acolytes y déploient une session de toute beauté associant leurs tubes à des nouveautés extraites de leur nouvel album : Tako Tsubo.

Mélopées rêveuses, orchestration éthérée et vibrations retro : L'Impératrice invite à l'indolence et à une insouciance généralisées. Ses arguments ? Une douce voix féminine et des sonorités vintage à souhait qui ravivent l'âge d'or de la French Touch, Daft Punk et Air en tête. Entre funk, space disco, revival 90's et influences tiki, la musique de L'Impératrice sonne familière tout en étant d'une grande fraîcheur.Après le succès de l’album Matahari (2018), L’Impératrice se rappelle à notre bon souvenir avec un tout nouvel album baptisé Tako Tsubo. Introduit par de nombreux singles – dont le très remarqué « La Peur des filles » - ce deuxième opus permet au groupe de montrer un visage plus éclectique mais toujours aussi dansant. Le changement dans la continuité en somme.

En plus de la musique de L’Impératrice, ce Passengers permet de se pâmer devant la beauté de la nef du Grand Palais. Ce bijou de la Belle Epoque amorçant tout juste une mue devant durer plusieurs années, ce serait bête de s’en priver.

Concert enregistré le 24 février 2021 au Grand Palais, Paris.

""Make your Dream be a Beautiful One""

You will still be in it for this time you chose, and Now you realize what's your roll in it.

You decide to see and be aware of the symbols or just to be carried by them in a random way.
 No good or bad luck, there is a Universal Intelligence holding it all to show and give you the opportunity to meet who you really are.

When things seem good you are remembering, when things are not, you are just realizing that was not your real pathway.

This is a Mix to adventure your self into your own Jungle where you can see treasures and beauty to then share in this Dream Awake

/P.s. MSK is one of the first stoner/psych bands I've discovered back in the days & I'll always love the album Soma.. have so many great memories with that record. This band manages to push me through variety of moods during their songs and it's not always easy - so to say./

NEVER MACHINE

Rain and fire, thunder sky... vortex drifting
Hidden deep in the holes of time
Reality's shifting
Close your eyes for the machine
Hell construction
Will come and take your inner dreams
Into the nothing

The machine is ancient, black and old
Doomsday tool
Got no feelings, the heart is cold
In the hands of fools
From the future, from the past, eons of crumbling
It will blow your mind to Kingdom Come
Void is rumbling

Never machine
The never machine
You stare into the emptiness
Never machine
The never machine
Erasing all the yesterdays

Evil thing... you'll eat the light inside my soul
Life's forgotten
It leaves no shadow, leaves no hope
Black machine... box of smoke and sorrow
Press the button
And your dreams are swallowed whole

THE SCEPTRE

Their war was without no end
A thousand hundred dark dreams
The Red Queen and the Black (the Swan)
Sisters... enemies

The Red and the Black Queens at war
From dawn to dusk and over again
For the Crown, the Kingdom, a Throne
For the Sceptre and the Power

Through the garden and the willow trees
The Red Queen rides on her rat
With armor and sword in hand
The spear of fate on her back

A sceptre for a queen

The Red Queen, the warrior, the brave
Charged forward on her rat
The Black Swan, furious with rage
Spread her wings for attack

She drowned her sister with fire
And the Red one put the sword in her twin
The Sceptre was lost in the battle
Now let the war begin

In the ruins of the castle walls
The swans saw the new day sun
And the Black Swan with the crown on her head
Rose from the Ivory Throne

A sceptre for a queen
Deception and deceit
Here comes the queen
The sceptre for a queen
There's evil in this dream

Acid King - Beyond Vision (Full Album 2023),"Available on LP / CD / Cassette from Blues Funeral Recordings at:https://bluesfuneral.com
Or:https://bluesfuneralrecordings.bandcamp.com Or:https://en.bluesfuneral.spkr.media
Beyond Vision began as an experiment and became the path to a silver future, marking the
dawn of a new era for a band that historically relied almost exclusively on thundering riffage.
Recorded by longtime producer Billy Anderson, the album&#39;s songs flow into each other without
beginning or ending, propelled by an undulating, lysergic pulse that takes listeners wherever
they&#39;d like to go. One might even call it a concept record, with themes that contemplate
interplanetary migration, the winding path of existence, and how we expect this trip to go one
way, only to find it taking directions we never imagined. Don&#39;t get it twisted, though: there are
blistering guitars and swirling power dirges aplenty. Beyond Vision is undeniably Acid King, now
in widescreen technicolor and interstellar cinemascope.

Acid King are heavy rock royalty, creators of some of the most monolithic riffs and heaviest tones ever known. At long last, they return with Beyond Vision, their first new album since 2015's Middle Of Nowhere, Center of Everywhere.

With blistering guitars and swirling power dirges aplenty, Beyond Vision began as an experiment and became the path to a silver future. Recorded by longtime producer Billy Anderson, the songs flow into each other without beginning or ending, propelled by an undulating, lysergic pulse that takes listeners wherever they'd like to go.

Tracing the winding path of interplanetary existence, Beyond Vision is a monumental return, and begins a new era for the band who built the template for thundering, swinging, trip-inducing doom.

WyndRider is a four-piece #Stoner #Doom band from the mountains of East Tennessee. with their first show played in March of 2022. The debut self-titled album, WyndRider, was recorded in late September of the same year by Danielle Fehr from The Wizard Productions. The recordings are the most raw, natural sounding form of the songs that the band was able to capture in a studio setting, while still emulating the energy of a live performance. Bands such as Black Sabbath, Steppenwolf, and Budgie inspired their take on a continuation of heavy and psychedelic music. The themes of this album are a culmination of subjects such as apocalypse, alien life, the Satanic Panic, and sarcastic dissection of the Christian Church. It portrays a new version of the physical, biting addictiveness that Rock and Roll inspired for another generation.

North African Raï Tapes and Records with Cheb Mimo,"#vinylmix #majandfriends #raï
All music rights belong to their rightful owners. Please support the musicians and buy their music.
------------
Cheb Mimo is a versatile artist whose eclectic taste in music has been influenced by his global upbringing. With roots in Algeria and Tunisia, having lived in France and Mexico, and currently is based in London, he has been collecting music records and cassettes from all corners of the world since a young age. Throughout his extensive exploration of various musical genres, Cheb Mimo has developed an even deeper appreciation for his roots and his rich North African cultural heritage. His love for Raï music is evident in his radio shows, club nights, and publications, where he enthusiastically shares its unique sounds and rhythms with a wider audience. Cheb Mimo, “Cheb” (meaning “young”) in homage to notable Raï musicians, is also the co-founder and resident DJ of “Raï-naissance,” a club night in his hometown Tunis that is quickly becoming a crowd favorite.

“Being Algerian and Tunisian, Raï has always been a part of my life. It has accompanied all of my family gatherings and parties with friends throughout my childhood, teenage and young adult years. It is my utmost priority to share this slice of my cultural heritage with the rest of the world, and in curating this episode, I have endeavored to showcase this rich genre in its most authentic form. From the iconic trumpet of Messaoud Bellemou to the inimitable voice of Cheb Khaled, every track has been chosen to represent the essence of Raï and foster greater appreciation and understanding of this beautiful and unique genre.”

Mars Red Sky - Mars Red Sky & Queen Of The Meadow (2023) [Full EP],"Tracklist:
00:00 - Maps Of Inferno
07:17 - Out At Large
12:57 - Maps Of Inferno (shortcut)

Notes:
""When the power of psychedelic heavy meets the depth of dark folk harmonies, it results in a complex and exhilarating flavor. The daring combination opens up the genres to a whole new dimension. MARS RED SKY's new EP, soberly entitled ""Mars Red Sky & Queen Of The Meadow"", exalts and enhances the trio's magic formula: namely, the blend of a robust and determined rhythm section with jagged and ambitious vocals, all evolving within a unique soundscape. The two tracks of the record suggest a disturbing journey through an immense maze directly inspired by mad architect Piranesi and his towers with terrifying staircases. Real melodic narrative, Queen Of The Meadow's vocals carve out an unexpected intensity. Mars Red Sky offers here an abyssal production, polished and unheard of.""

Credits:
Helen Ferguson - lead vocals and melodies
Julien Pras - guitars, back-up vocals
Jimmy Kinast - bass
Matgaz - drums

All songs composed, written and arranged by Mars Red Sky and Queen Of The Meadow.

Produced, recorded and mixed by Benjamin Mandeau at Cryogène Studio, Bègles (France).
Mastering by Ladislav Agabekov at Caduceus Studios, Gimel (Switzerland).
Band photography by Jessica Calvo (photography), Fluor_99 (artwork).

Sign of Osiris Slain

We are a legion, have brought you down, forever
Salt and burning sulphur will cover your land
War is our religion, our destiny to conquer
We dream about the heat and endless sand

You have been the guiding light,
the rhythm of the river,
a keeper of the beat in the hearts of the brave
All light has been extinguished now,
your armour stripped and ruined
Within an empire fallen,
a ritual grave

Everywhere you look these days,
You see more death and fear
Faceless soldiers marching in despair
Following the ancient way
the rhythm lord was taken
and torn in five directions, flesh laid bare

See his lonely trip through time
See him chained to crippling fear
And though the world now must be blind:
The Judgment day is drawing near!


The Answer

The skies light up the night
In shades of burning fire
Leave me with no place to hide
The naked truth it makes me blind

Life is just like a battlefield
Next day is just like the other
I’m locked inside a darkened world
Loss and pain always on my mind

I need to find the answer
There’s nothing left for me
Forever trying to find a way out
It was never meant to be this way

There was never any hope for us
Since we began this struggle
So we will show no fear
Death is always on our side

Our lives are hanging by a thread
Knowing each breath could be the last
Mothers they will cry in fear and sorrow
When they see what we have become

You will never find the answer
Unless you search within your soul
The fire that devours you must burn out
Ashes of doubt now turn to dust


Endless November

If you had been to those places
And seen all the things I have seen
Then would you still dream of perfection?
And what kind of life it would mean?
I have returned to the living
From the land of the lost
But I can still feel the same longing
I felt when I travelled that land

Rain falls on me
Making me feel like I’m alive
Endless rivers,
Their streams are still drowning my eyes
Did you have to surrender to our sorrow?
Did you have to abandon our way?
Pressures are revealing secrets of the soul
And only the humble remain

Like a leaf that has lost all direction
Cast aside by the cold Autumn wind
I stare at the endless horizon,
And try to forget where I have been
Too proud to beg your forgiveness
I still whisper your name
Too late to admit I’m still sinking
I measure the cost of my shame


Sign of Osiris Risen

Collecting pieces of what once was me, she joins them silently by hand
She works her way on the familiar figure, I feel the pressure, an urge to see

Extreme heat inside the coffin home, carried through the dying land
I know my son because I swallowed his eye; this was the moment, my mind set free:

Lord of Love, Lord of Silence, Lord of the Dead. A process of imitation,
return of vegetation through the flood. His backbone and His river, a Sacred Ram kept in His memory. The Soul of the Lord, of the pillar of Stability. His genitals divided, worshipped His will, His fertility. Gloomy, solemn, mournful actions for the rebirth of the grain. Sister in the sorrow, sharing His Kingdom with the Dead. If wheat and clay were transformed, He will always be the Perfect One.

This was all revealed to me in the movements of a ritual
Hooded figures guiding me through the moments of despair
Witnessing the sign of silence, I understand the union:
Between man and a woman there’s a return

Nail by nail and bone to bone, he is to be complete again
Like a beast he is reborn: On his feet and near perfection
Blood is rushing through his veins, his heart now beats with pain
Shivering, this deadly form, he dreams with open eyes

Hand in hand we rise and pray for those who came before us
We will let our love burn and our slaves will lose their sight
Resurrecting heavens vast we reflect the light that once was
Horrid is the might we bear as we strike back the night

Hope that you can hear the same strong and brave voice that I heard
The order of the guiding signs remains the same ...just like above
All I said throughout the night ...I did mean every word
Can you share this mystery with me, my only true love?

The 70s and early 80s Psychedelic, Prog Rock & Folk music from Brittany (Bretagne, France) 
Léna C. is a Manchester/West Yorkshire based DJ and producer born and bred in Brittany, France.

Wizard Tattoo is the self-titled debut concept EP from Indianapolis multi instrumentalist Bram the Bard. It tells the story of a man who starts hearing a dark voice shortly after getting a tattoo. Throughout the four tracks, listen to his musical journey of delusion. Is he really becoming a wizard or is he just going mad?

""If Wizard Tattoo keeps releasing great records such as this then the Doom/Stoner Metal Underground scene are going to love this band like I do already."" - Outlaws of the Sun

""Another band with true grit at the Crossroads of America."" ""Trust me, you'll be entertained."" - Doomed & Stoned

""Dirty, groove and doom with all manner of fuzz and distortion sticking to the riffs like glue. It’s a very imaginative track that culminates in something quite filthy sounding."" - Games, Brrraaains & A Head-Banging Life

""Outstanding: The whole thing, the various composition/characteristics, moods/atmosphere. Especially the last track, 'No Return' -just mesmerizing, powerful, and magical about the piece -draws the listener in."" - Metal 1on1

""This is a worthy listen, and I would be down to check out what comes next. 7/10"" - Musipedia of Metal

Notes:
""Grand Atomic is a full- blown hard-hitting stoner trio formed in 2016 in Norway, with a mission to make bonecrushing, fuzzed- out music as they did back in the 70`s and 90`s. The band takes influences from bands like Electric Wizard, Sleep and OM, but in the process made a sound of their own.""

""Whether it's for the headphones or the dancefloor, I always map out sets with a beginning, middle and end, taking listeners on a journey.  I've been obsessed with tracks that evoke emotion with a cinematic feel, so this represents a small cross section of my record collection with music from 1968 right through to present day in 2023.""

Born & raised in Malaga, Avi Del Mono now lives in Lisbon after 20 years of being immersed in London's music scene.  He was the General Manager for Boiler Room and hosted his radio show ""Hear No Evil"" on NTS & Run Dem Radio, whilst photographing some of the city's important music events.  Avi's range of influences has made his sets a landing spot for soul, hip-hop, dub, UKG and everything in between.

Space Shepherds came about through a mutual love of fast-paced kraut-rock, shoe-gaze, and heavy hitting doom riffs. Formed in Belfast, Ireland in 2017 by David Malone and Gareth Hill, the duo have spent years honing their craft in order to provide trance-inducing music and electric live shows. As the duo have progressed, so has the makeup of Space Shepherds which has come to include a wider range of instruments and players. With the core guitar and drums being supplied by Gareth and David, the music has grown to also incorporate bass, synths, more guitars, percussion sections, flutes and world instruments such as didgeridoos. The drop-in-drop-out element of the band ensures that no two improvisational jams are the same and this does much to keep it fresh and exciting.

Occult-tinged stoner doom from Sweden, Moon Coven just keep going from strength to strength. Their last album for Ripple, Slumber Wood was described by The Sleeping Shaman as ""totally blown away by the avalanche of awesome stoner-doom riffage contained therein. It’s unusual to come across an album in such a crowded genre that sounds completely fresh and delivers such quality tunes from start to finish."" And the band simply ups the ante on this, their third album.

Pressed on very limited edition milky clear and black galaxy vinyl.

Si vous me permettez une petite digression, j'aimerais vous présenter aujourd'hui l'un des albums que j'attendais le plus de cette année : Corpo Mente, par le groupe du même nom. Si vous vous intéressez à l'extrême sous toutes ses formes et que vous n'êtes pas fermés aux musiques électroniques, il n'est pas impossible que vous ayez déjà croisé le chemin de Gautier Serre, la tête pensante du projet Igorrr, mais aussi l'auteur des péripéties cyber-grindcore Whourkr. Et c'est accompagné de Laure Le Prunenec qu'il nous propose aujourd'hui une œuvre beaucoup plus intime, résultat d'un travail effectué dans l'ombre de leurs projets respectifs (Laure Le Prunenec chante dans Öxxö Xööx, mais aussi chez Igorrr). Corpo Mente, c'est donc le projet folk, baroque, trip-hop, que sais-je encore, de deux génies de la musique marqués par une personnalité très forte aux influences multiples et variées.

C'est en 2013 que paraît le premier morceau, Dorma. Le coup de cœur est instantané, écoutez-moi donc cette volupté, cette élégance, ce chant cristallin ; et surtout, ce sentiment de ""jamais entendu"" ! Le morceau a longtemps tourné en boucle sur mon pc, j'en voulais plus ! Et ce vœu est maintenant exaucé.

L'album s'ouvre sur Scylla, on retrouve les éléments qui faisaient la force de Dorma, à savoir un sens de la composition et de l'ambiance qui file des frissons. Laure Le Prunenec fait la démonstration de toute sa palette vocale, avec un timbre tantôt cristallin, tantôt très chaleureux, et se permet même quelques passages légèrement écorchés, d'une puissance à hérisser le poil. Sur Arsalein, on reconnaît assez facilement le sens très particulier de la rythmique typique d'Igorrr. Le timbre de la chanteuse se permet encore plus de passages écorchés, tout en proposant des vocalises dignes d'un opéra. La fin du morceau est en apothéose, mêlant des rythmiques dont on ressent l'influence breakcore à de gros accords saturés à la guitare. Dulcin et Ort proposeront eux aussi cette puissance toute métallique qui pourrait accrocher l'oreille de nos lecteurs les plus accrocs au gros son, mais globalement, leur musique se fait plus sensible, à fleur de peau.

Cet album se démarque vraiment de tout ce que j'ai pu entendre d'autre en folk, notamment par ses influences sorties d'un opéra, le tout mêlé à toutes sortes d'éléments issues de différents genres. Malgré le fait que je sois subjugué, j'ai du mal à en parler dans le détail ; et pour cause, c'est la première fois que je vous parle d'un album n'étant pas du metal. Mais bon sang, pour l'amour de la musique, écoutez-moi cet album !

LYRICS:
""Sunset lightning in my eyes
Druid coming back to life
I can't find my way to home
I'm nothing more than painted stone
My Mind is foggy, twisted time
Sending shivers down my spine
Hit the ground and it stands still
But drink it down and the blood will spill
Faces coming out of trees
Bed that's floating on the sea
I should not have had that drink
But there's more to elves than you would think
You re wrong if you think they'll spare you
They'll keep you safe in their people zoo
I must crawl out of this hole
And pray to someone to save my soul
Woah, bless my soul
I'm gonna lose my mind 
Woah, bless my soul
I'm gonna lose my mind
Woah, bless my soul
I'm gonna lose my mind
Woah, bless my soul
I'm gonna lose my mind
Woah, bless my soul
I'm gonna lose my mind 
Woah, bless my soul
I'm gonna lose my mind
Swim in the forest of faded muse
Somewhere I have left my shoes
Hear their steps but its hard to see 
There's no one coming after me
Crawling into the pool of youth
Scrambling past the caves of truth
Dreams will ends and the walls cave in
The great illusion is paper thin""

recorded at the Abraham Mosque, Manchester

'Mullah Said' displays two aspects of the work of Muslimgauze. Firstly, musically, it is in the delightful drifting ambient vein. The percussion is mainly acoustic hand drums - providing a rhythm of aural features - the trademark shimmering string sound heard on a number of releases is much in evidence, rhythms are generally slower, there are lots of samples of people speaking in conversation, markets wherever. 'Mullah said' opens the disc with the lovely mix of these sounds. 'Every grain of Palestine sand' continues the mood, with a slightly faster tempo, and more emphasis on the beat. But it soon locks into a mesmeric lassitude as various effects echo or smear the sounds, drums come in for short moments, different string sounds enjoin the play. 'Muslims die India' follows the mood though the voices seem darker, sadder, and then comes 'Every grain of Palestinian sand' followed by 'Muslims die India'. Yes - not a typo, these tracks are repeated. This is the second Muslimgauze trend - to remix himself. On a number of releases there are tracks with the same title, sometimes called part 1 and 2, and usually they are about the same length and listening indicates they are versions of the same song. With the two here, the samples occur at about the same time, the instrumentation is similar, and what we get is subtle variations - different effects, placement of instruments in the mix etc. This leaves us with a 50 minute suite of prime Muslimgauze middle eastern ambience - if you like that side you will love this album. The final track is short and different, a crackling ground over which a singer chants a song interrupted by machine-gun percussive bursts - 'An end'. For those who have difficulty getting the limited editions, Staalplaat will be releasing 'Observe with Sadiq Bey' which is said to be in the same style.

lyrics
J'Ngalee

Inside their mind's trails
Vast worms eating back
Awake the suffering inside
Eternally turning back

Feed the hate to this world
The glooming bliss you reach for
Drooling darkness and famines
Burning fire of dark desire

The last immortal king
Doomed to live to tell
Through the age of times
Across the plane of darkness

The last immortal king
Doomed to reincarnate
Through the eternal wheel
Across the age of sadness

In my heart...
In my mind...
J'Ngalee.

Feel the thunder in your soul
The burning bliss you reach for
Immortal fire burns down the throne
Everlasting flame of desire

Feel the lighting in your hands
The burning wish you reaching for
Look up the sky and prey for die
But you ever has to return again

02 Revel In Dissidence 02:07
""Affiliate with the timeless core
Abound in what is never more
Your time and space make no sense
I will revel in dissidence
The social code that breaks you down
Is what you must leave behind
The common sense imprisons you
is what you must annihilate
Magick will the only truth
The only path that emancipates
The state of mind must be sincere
Not the pseudo world of sleep
Affiliate with the timeless core
Abound in what is never more
Your time and space make no sense
I will revel in dissidence""
~
03 Paradigm Call 11:03
""Dead voices of the ages
Rise again in the here and now
Forgotten current
I call now in your hearts and minds
Forget your senses
Turn inwards to live again
The hidden sun is heavy
With power, light and bliss
Don't you ever think
Avoid your clever tricks
The fool is crowned now
In this paradigm call""
~
04 Among The Ruins 18:46
""An empire that never was
Can never crumble
A tower that never stood
Is forever standing
Bricks and stone
Time illusion frames
The fire in our souls
Will burn with your prisons
We of the serpents path
Beyond all reach
Prefer to dwell forever
Among the ruins
~
05 Black Smoke 24:02
""Everything is burning
Inner dragon rise
Black smoke is covering
Universe A B and C
From the graves of the earth
Black smoke
From the stars
Black Smoke
In the fractals of your mind
Black Smoke 
The Qlipoth is here
Black Smoke
Everything is burning
Inner dragon rise
Black smoke is covering
Universe A B and C
From the graves of the earth
Black smoke
From the stars
Black Smoke
In the fractals of your mind
Black Smoke 
The Qlipoth is here
Black Smoke
~
06 Ascending The Pale 31:33
""Veins of magma flow
Bones are wisdom's fold
Flesh is hidden light
Eyes are stars in sight
Ascending the pale
Breathing life and death
Ascending the pale
Breathing life and death
Karmic obstacles fall
Diamond mind of nought
All matter is a gate
I am only change
Ascending the pale
Breathing life and death
Ascending the pale
Breathing life and death
~
07 Empty Chalice 38:35
""Drawing in those around you
To your self pity maze of woe
Three eyes blind and sleeping
Pain is your chosen fate
Empty chalice
Feeble hands grip the chalice
The unholy springs always dry
Blame as an outward instinct
This is not love
but hate
Empty chalice

Before I Burn tells stories of egoism, greed, and the evil it promotes within people’s minds.
When it feels like the whole world is burning, do you punch out, or do you stay and burn?
Drums, bass, and guitars were tracked in the basement of an old building in downtown Oslo. Overdubs for guitar, as well as vocals and keys were tracked in different locations in and around Oslo. Like in the past, the band was in charge of the entire process from songwriting and artwork, to recording and mixing. However, mastering was done by Tony Reed (Mos Generator).

Beth Gibbons - Concert dans la Bibliothèque nationale de France - ARTE Concert,"#BETHGIBBONS 

Pouvait-on rêver plus belle association ? Le joyau rare de la pop anglo-saxonne de ces trente dernières années dans le lieu historique en charge de la conservation du patrimoine littéraire national. Beth Gibbons sur le site Richelieu, berceau de la Bibliothèque nationale de France au cœur de Paris : deux indispensables qui œuvrent dans l’ombre pour une quête d’éternité.

À la surexposition, Beth Gibbons a toujours préféré l’effacement. En 2024, après dix ans de quasi-silence, la chanteuse britannique a finalement publié Lives Outgrown, un premier album solo dans lequel elle se livre avec une proximité inédite, évoquant ses tourments féminins, la fuite du temps ou un amour finissant.

Après un unique concert donné à la salle Pleyel au printemps, elle est revenue en France pour enregistrer un numéro de la collection ""Passengers"", dans la majestueuse salle ovale de la bibliothèque Richelieu, à Paris. Sa voix toujours aussi vibrante relie des chansons délicatement orchestrées, dont la grâce musicale contraste avec une sombre intériorité. La solennité du décor, elle, renforce la rareté de ce moment suspendu.

Kozmik Makam - Psychedelic Prayers (1977) [Full Album],"Emerging from Istanbul's unique music culture in the late 1970s, *Kozmik Makam* was a groundbreaking _fictional_ band that pushed the boundaries of sound and spirit. The group was composed of musicians from diverse backgrounds, all of whom shared a deep-rooted interest in music and mysticism. Kozmik Makam fused ancient Anatolian melodies with the innovative rhythms of the West, blending the energetic spontaneity of jazz and Afrobeat with an unmistakable psychedelic flair.

Kozmik Makam began their journey performing on Istanbul's Galata and Kadıköy stages, quickly gaining a following among fans of experimental music. Their sound was hypnotic, often creating a ritualistic atmosphere that felt as ancient as it was fresh. Their debut album, Psychedelic Prayers, was filled with complex rhythms and hypnotic repetitions, offering a deep auditory experience. Each track on the album merged the mystical scales of the Middle East, the rhythmic intensity of Afrobeat, and the free-form improvisation of jazz. Electric guitar riffs intertwined with cosmic funk and powerful basslines, while analog synths and ethnic instruments transported listeners to another dimension.

Kozmik Makam’s live performances were renowned for their immersive, trance-inducing quality, mirroring the profound depth of their music. With Psychedelic Prayers, they captured the attention of the Turkish music scene and cemented themselves as pioneers of psychedelic rock and jazz fusion. The album was a journey of single-take, extended improvisations, and hypnotic, repetitive rhythms, offering a unique aural experience. Their success in Turkey led to international invitations, and Kozmik Makam soon found themselves performing at music festivals across Europe, particularly in Germany and France.

With the release of their debut album in 1977, Kozmik Makam achieved a cult status not only in Turkey but globally as well. The band seamlessly combined Western progressive rock with the mystical soul of the East, gaining a dedicated fanbase both at home and abroad. In their albums, Kozmik Makam managed to stay true to their roots while embracing the modern world, creating a timeless, universal musical language that spoke to listeners across generations.

The band’s music, rich with jazz improvisations, complex polyrhythms, ethnic melodies, and mesmerizing layers, offered an expansive auditory landscape. Kozmik Makam’s Psychedelic Prayers album remains a beloved classic among collectors and music enthusiasts, a testament to the band’s transcendent and boundary-breaking sound.

Habibi Habbas - Disco Kebab (1977) [Full Album],"*Habibi Habbas* is one of the most unusual _fictional_ musical groups of the period, formed in Libya in the mid-1970s and uniquely blending psychedelic rock, Arabic pop and funk. The group's name combines the word ""Habibi"", which reflects the warm and friendly atmosphere of Arab culture, with the expression ""Habbas"", which refers to groove-filled and energetic music. Their first album, ""Funky Caravan"", released in 1976, attracted attention both in the local and international music scene and brought them cult status.

The band members developed a unique sound that combined traditional Arabic music with Western psychedelic rock and funk trends. Funky Caravan offers the best examples of this unique music. The songs on the album have a structure enriched with guitar riffs, groovy bass lines, rhythmic percussion and deep, melodic Eastern instruments. The arabesque melodies in their songs create a mystical and hypnotic atmosphere, while the funky rhythms of the West invite the listener to dance.

Although Habibi Habbas did not achieve widespread commercial success, their first album, Funky Caravan, released in 1976, is considered a work that reflects the musical spirit of a period and has achieved cult status years later.

Camellas - Melancholic Desert (1976) [Full Album],"🎁 You can support us in the music production process. Thank you!
- https://buymeacoffee.com/heingart
- https://patreon.com/heingart (Patreon) *Camellas* is a fictional psychedelic rock band known for weaving rich, desert-inspired soundscapes and deeply immersive music. Formed in 1973, Camellas emerged at the height of the psychedelic rock era, blending elements of classic rock with unique, atmospheric tones that transport listeners into the heart of an endless desert journey. 

*Band Origins and Style*
Camellas was initially formed by four musicians driven by a shared love for experimental music that blended both Western rock and Middle Eastern influences. Each member brought a distinct element to the band’s sound—hypnotic, bluesy guitar riffs, deep, groove-laden bass lines, and drumming inspired by tribal rhythms. The vocals, often drenched in reverb, echo through their tracks like distant calls across the desert, adding a layer of mystique and depth to their music.

*Musical Influence and Desert Aesthetic*
Drawing inspiration from bands like Pink Floyd and The Doors, Camellas developed a sound that felt both otherworldly and grounded. They used desert themes not just as aesthetic, but as a philosophical core. The desert, in Camellas’ music, represents a vast, timeless landscape—an expanse where one can be lost and found, experience isolation and introspection, and encounter both hardship and beauty.

*Legacy and Cultural Impact*
Though fictional, Camellas would be the kind of band that cultivates a cult following among fans of retro psychedelic rock and those seeking a unique sonic experience. Their music could be seen as both a product of its time—the 1970s fascination with mind-expanding music and desert escapism—and timeless, appealing to fans of modern psychedelic and stoner rock who seek a deep, immersive sound.

LYRICS:
""I shall rule your body
I shall rule your soul
Devour you whole
As I am in control
And I shall rule your body
And I shall rule your soul
Devour you whole
As I am in control 
Voices weakened after a long sleep
When they wakened
they cried to dream again
 
(Whispered)
‚‘‘This thing of darkness
I acknowledge mine‘‘
Is the burden we must all decline 

If you‘re a witch then you will float, too
There’s nothing that I could do for you
If you‘re a witch then you will float, too
There’s nothing that I could do for you
Caliban and the witch
Caliban and the witch
Caliban and the witch
Caliban and the witch
And I shall rule your body
And I shall rule your soul
Devour you whole
As I am in control
And Voices weakened after a long sleep
And When they wakened
they cried to dream again
Caliban and the witch
Caliban and the witch
Caliban and the witch
Caliban and the witch""

After the long awaited release of their second album, Terraform, Yo No Se return with an album of “B Sides” and tracks recorded during the first UK lockdown. Having been away for so long the band have been sitting on a lot of material and we’re delighted to get these tracks out there.

Some of the songs are taken from the Terraform recording session while others were recorded at home and features a very different side to Yo No Se. Using bouzouki and cello to explore and expand their sound as well as slipping in a cover of Bert Jansch’s Poison. Theres several different members, engineers and locations in this album which were again mastered by Jack Endino.

Continuing on where Terraform left off the album continues to explore corruption, paranoia, new world exploration and anarchy.
