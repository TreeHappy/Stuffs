# Causal Inference

## Confounders

* DAG of the causal relationships
* Confounders can be found and can be taken care of with structures in the graph

* Paths can be open or closed
  * open path there is a causal relation
    * changes in one do changes in the other and vica versa
  * closed path no causal relation
    * changes do not change anything on the other

* causal path A -> C
  * change in A changes things in C
